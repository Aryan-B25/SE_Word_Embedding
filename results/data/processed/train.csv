"An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions for solving a computational problem. Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and software development. They can be expressed in various forms including natural language, pseudocode, flowcharts, and programming languages. Common algorithmic paradigms include divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking. Algorithm analysis involves studying time and space complexity.",wikipedia,59,469,0.07547169811320754
"How to implement a binary search algorithm in Python? I need to implement a binary search algorithm in Python. What is the most efficient way to do this? Should I use recursion or iteration? Here s what I have so far: python def binary_search(arr, target): left, right 0, len(arr) - 1 while left right: mid (left right) 2 if arr mid target: return mid elif arr mid target: left mid 1 else: right mid - 1 return -1 Is this implementation correct? Are there any optimizations I can make?",stackoverflow,89,485,0.031746031746031744
"A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are managed by database management systems (DBMS). Common types include relational databases, NoSQL databases, and graph databases. SQL is the standard language for relational database management. Database design involves normalization, indexing, and query optimization to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.",wikipedia,60,455,0.0784313725490196

"A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used to implement algorithms and create software applications. They can be classified into various paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, functional, and declarative programming. Popular programming languages include Python, Java, JavaScript, C , Go, and Rust. Each language has its own syntax, semantics, and use cases.",wikipedia,65,471,0.03773584905660377
