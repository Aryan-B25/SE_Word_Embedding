"Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software. It involves the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. Key principles include modularity, abstraction, encapsulation, and separation of concerns. Modern software engineering practices emphasize agile methodologies, continuous integration, and test-driven development. The field encompasses requirements analysis, software design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.",wikipedia,59,520,0.09302325581395349
"A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types and are essential components of efficient algorithms. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. The choice of data structure affects the efficiency of algorithms and the overall performance of software systems.",wikipedia,65,448,0.043478260869565216
"What is the difference between and in JavaScript? I m confused about the difference between and operators in JavaScript. When should I use each one?
