    "text": "Adversarial machine learning is the study of the attacks on machine learning algorithms, and of the defenses against such attacks. A survey from May 2020 revealed practitioners common feeling for better protection of machine learning systems in industrial applications. Machine learning techniques are mostly designed to work on specific problem sets, under the assumption that the training and test data are generated from the same statistical distribution IID . However, this assumption is often dangerously violated in practical high stake applications, where users may intentionally supply fabricated data that violates the statistical assumption. Most common attacks in adversarial machine learning include evasion attacks, data poisoning attacks, Byzantine attacks and model extraction.",

    "title": "Software load testing",
    "text": "The term load testing or stress testing is used in different ways in the professional software testing community. Load testing generally refers to the practice of modeling the expected usage of a software program by simulating multiple users accessing the program concurrently. As such, this testing is most relevant for multi user systems; often one built using a client server model, such as web servers. However, other types of software systems can also be load tested. For example, a word processor or graphics editor can be forced to read an extremely large document; or a financial package can be forced to generate a report based on several years worth of data. The most accurate load testing simulates actual use, as opposed to testing using theoretical or analytical modeling. Load testing lets you measure your website s quality of service QOS performance based on actual customer behavior. Nearly all the load testing tools and frameworks follow the classical load testing paradigm: when customers visit your website, a script recorder records the communication and then creates related interaction scripts. A load generator tries to replay the recorded scripts, which could possibly be modified with different test parameters before replay. In the replay procedure, both the hardware and software statistics will be monitored and collected by the conductor, these statistics include the CPU, memory, disk IO of the physical servers and the response time, the throughput of the system under test SUT , etc. And at last, all these statistics will be analyzed and a load testing report will be generated. Load and performance testing analyzes software intended for a multi user audience by subjecting the software to different numbers of virtual and live users while monitoring performance measurements under these different loads. Load and performance testing is usually conducted in a test environment identical to the production environment before the software system is permitted to go live. Objectives of load testing: To ensure that the system meets performance benchmarks; To determine the breaking point of the system; To test the way the product reacts to load induced downtimes. As an example, a website with shopping cart capability is required to support 100 concurrent users broken out into the following activities: 25 virtual users VUsers log in, browse through items and then log off 25 VUsers log in, add items to their shopping cart, check out and then log off 25 VUsers log in, return items previously purchased and then log off 25 VUsers just log in without any subsequent activity A test analyst can use various load testing tools to create these VUsers and their activities. Once the test has started and reached a steady state, the application is being tested at the 100 VUser loads as described above. The application s performance can then be monitored and captured. The specifics of a load test plan or script will generally vary across organizations. For example, in the bulleted list above, the first item could represent 25 VUsers browsing unique items, random items, or a selected set of items depending upon the test plan or script developed. However, all load test plans attempt to simulate system performance across a range of anticipated peak workflows and volumes. The criteria for passing or failing a load test pass fail criteria are generally different across organizations as well. There are no standards specifying acceptable load testing performance metrics. A common misconception is that load testing software provides record and playback capabilities like regression testing tools. Load testing tools analyze the entire OSI protocol stack whereas most regression testing tools focus on GUI performance. For example, a regression testing tool will record and playback a mouse click on a button on a web browser, but a load testing tool will send out hypertext the web browser sends after the user clicks the button. In a multiple user environment, load testing tools can send out hypertext for multiple users with each user having a unique login ID, password, etc. The popular load testing tools available also provide insight into the causes for slow performance. There are numerous possible causes for slow system performance, including, but not limited to, the following: Application server s or software Database server s Network latency, congestion, etc. Client side processing Load balancing between multiple servers Load testing is especially important if the application, system, or service will be subject to a service level agreement or SLA. Load testing is performed to determine a system s behavior under both normal and anticipated peak load conditions. It helps to identify the maximum operating capacity of an application as well as any bottlenecks and determine which element is causing degradation. When the load placed on the system is raised beyond normal usage patterns to test the system s response at unusually high or peak loads, it is known as stress testing. The load is usually so great that error conditions are the expected result, but there is no clear boundary when an activity ceases to be a load test and becomes a stress test. The term load testing is often used synonymously with concurrency testing, software performance testing, reliability testing, and volume testing for specific scenarios. All of these are types of non functional testing that are not part of functionality testing used to validate suitability for use of any given software.",

    "text": "A database transaction symbolizes a unit of work, performed within a database management system or similar system against a database, that is treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions. A transaction generally represents any change in a database. Transactions in a database environment have two main purposes: To provide reliable units of work that allow correct recovery from failures and keep a database consistent even in cases of system failure. For example: when execution prematurely and unexpectedly stops completely or partially in which case many operations upon a database remain uncompleted, with unclear status. To provide isolation between programs accessing a database concurrently. If this isolation is not provided, the programs outcomes are possibly erroneous. In a database management system, a transaction is a single unit of logic or work, sometimes made up of multiple operations. Any logical calculation done in a consistent mode in a database is known as a transaction. One example is a transfer from one bank account to another: the complete transaction requires subtracting the amount to be transferred from one account and adding that same amount to the other. A database transaction, by definition, must be atomic it must either be complete in its entirety or have no effect whatsoever , consistent it must conform to existing constraints in the database , isolated it must not affect other transactions and durable it must get written to persistent storage . Database practitioners often refer to these properties of database transactions using the acronym ACID.",

Design goals of Git include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non linear workflows thousands of parallel branches running on different computers. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client server systems, Git maintains a local copy of the entire repository, also known as repo , with history and version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. A repository is stored on each computer in a standard directory with additional, hidden files to provide version control capabilities. Git provides features to synchronize changes between repositories that share history; copied cloned from each other. For collaboration, Git supports synchronizing with repositories on remote machines. Although all repositories with the same history are peers, developers often use a central server to host a repository to hold an integrated copy. Git is free and open source software shared under the GPL 2.0 only license. Git was originally created by Linus Torvalds for version control in the development of the Linux kernel. The trademark Git is registered by the Software Freedom Conservancy, marking its official recognition and continued evolution in the open source community. Today, Git is the de facto standard version control system. It is the most popular distributed version control system, with nearly 95 of developers reporting it as their primary version control system as of 2022. It is the most widely used source code management tool among professional developers. There are offerings of Git repository services, including GitHub, SourceForge, Bitbucket and GitLab.",

    "title": "WebSocket",
    "text": "WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing a simultaneous two way communication channel over a single Transmission Control Protocol TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011. The current specification allowing web applications to use this protocol is known as WebSockets. It is a living standard maintained by the WHATWG and a successor to The WebSocket API from the W3C. WebSocket is distinct from HTTP used to serve most webpages. Although they are different, RFC 6455 states that WebSocket is designed to work over HTTP ports 443 and 80 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries , thus making it compatible with HTTP. To achieve compatibility, the WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol. The WebSocket protocol enables full duplex interaction between a web browser or other client application and a web server with lower overhead than half duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real time data transfer from and to the server. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the client without being first requested by the client, and allowing messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open. In this way, a two way ongoing conversation can take place between the client and the server. The communications are usually done over TCP port number 443 or 80 in the case of unsecured connections , which is beneficial for environments that block non web Internet connections using a firewall. Additionally, WebSocket enables streams of messages on top of TCP. TCP alone deals with streams of bytes with no inherent concept of a message. Similar two way browser server communications have been achieved in non standardized ways using stopgap technologies such as Comet or Adobe Flash Player. Most browsers support the protocol, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera. The WebSocket protocol specification defines ws WebSocket and wss WebSocket Secure as two new uniform resource identifier URI schemes that are used for unencrypted and encrypted connections respectively. Apart from the scheme name and fragment i.e. is not supported , the rest of the URI components are defined to use URI generic syntax.",

The capabilities of a class differ between programming languages, but generally the shared aspects consist of state variables and behavior methods that are each either associated with a particular object or with all objects of that class. Object state can differ between each instance of the class whereas the class state is shared by all of them. The object methods include access to the object state via an implicit or explicit parameter that references the object whereas class methods do not. If the language supports inheritance, a class can be defined based on another class with all of its state and behavior plus additional state and behavior that further specializes the class. The specialized class is a sub class, and the class it is based on is its superclass.",

    "text": "In programming languages, a closure, also lexical closure or function closure, is a technique for implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with first class functions. Operationally, a closure is a record storing a function together with an environment. The environment is a mapping associating each free variable of the function variables that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created. Unlike a plain function, a closure allows the function to access those captured variables through the closure s copies of their values or references, even when the function is invoked outside their scope.",

    "title": "Active learning (machine learning)",
    "text": "Active learning is a special case of machine learning in which a learning algorithm can interactively query a human user or some other information source , to label new data points with the desired outputs. The human user must possess knowledge expertise in the problem domain, including the ability to consult research authoritative sources when necessary. In statistics literature, it is sometimes also called optimal experimental design. The information source is also called teacher or oracle. There are situations in which unlabeled data is abundant but manual labeling is expensive. In such a scenario, learning algorithms can actively query the user teacher for labels. This type of iterative supervised learning is called active learning. Since the learner chooses the examples, the number of examples to learn a concept can often be much lower than the number required in normal supervised learning. With this approach, there is a risk that the algorithm is overwhelmed by uninformative examples. Recent developments are dedicated to multi label active learning, hybrid active learning and active learning in a single pass on line context, combining concepts from the field of machine learning e.g. conflict and ignorance with adaptive, incremental learning policies in the field of online machine learning. Using active learning allows for faster development of a machine learning algorithm, when comparative updates would require a quantum or super computer. Large scale active learning projects may benefit from crowdsourcing frameworks such as Amazon Mechanical Turk that include many humans in the active learning loop.",

The link between data can also be called a connector. In linked data structures, the links are usually treated as special data types that can only be dereferenced or compared for equality. Linked data structures are thus contrasted with arrays and other data structures that require performing arithmetic operations on pointers. This distinction holds even when the nodes are actually implemented as elements of a single array, and the references are actually array indices: as long as no arithmetic is done on those indices, the data structure is essentially a linked one. Linking can be done in two ways using dynamic allocation and using array index linking. Linked data structures include linked lists, search trees, expression trees, and many other widely used data structures. They are also key building blocks for many efficient algorithms, such as topological sort and set union find.",

    "text": "Software architecture is the set of structures needed to reason about a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations. The architecture of a software system is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building. It functions as the blueprints for the system and the development project, which project management can later use to extrapolate the tasks necessary to be executed by the teams and people involved. Software architecture is about making fundamental structural choices that are costly to change once implemented. Software architecture choices include specific structural options from possibilities in the design of the software. There are two fundamental laws in software architecture: Everything is a trade off Why is more important than how Architectural Kata is a teamwork which can be used to produce an architectural solution that fits the needs. Each team extracts and prioritizes architectural characteristics aka non functional requirements then models the components accordingly. The team can use C4 Model which is a flexible method to model the architecture just enough. Note that synchronous communication between architectural components, entangles them and they must share the same architectural characteristics. Documenting software architecture facilitates communication between stakeholders, captures early decisions about the high level design, and allows the reuse of design components between projects.: 29 35 Software architecture design is commonly juxtaposed with software application design. Whilst application design focuses on the design of the processes and data supporting the required functionality the services offered by the system , software architecture design focuses on designing the infrastructure within which application functionality can be realized and executed such that the functionality is provided in a way which meets the system s non functional requirements. Software architectures can be categorized into two main types: monolith and distributed architecture, each having its own subcategories. Software architecture tends to become more complex over time. Software architects should use fitness functions to continuously keep the architecture in check.",

Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance. ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics. Statistics and mathematical optimisation mathematical programming methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis EDA via unsupervised learning.

    "title": "Quantum machine learning",
    "text": "Quantum machine learning is the integration of quantum algorithms within machine learning programs. The most common use of the term refers to machine learning algorithms for the analysis of classical data executed on a quantum computer, i.e. quantum enhanced machine learning. While machine learning algorithms are used to compute immense quantities of data, quantum machine learning utilizes qubits and quantum operations or specialized quantum systems to improve computational speed and data storage done by algorithms in a program. This includes hybrid methods that involve both classical and quantum processing, where computationally difficult subroutines are outsourced to a quantum device. These routines can be more complex in nature and executed faster on a quantum computer. Furthermore, quantum algorithms can be used to analyze quantum states instead of classical data. Beyond quantum computing, the term quantum machine learning is also associated with classical machine learning methods applied to data generated from quantum experiments i.e. machine learning of quantum systems , such as learning the phase transitions of a quantum system or creating new quantum experiments. Quantum machine learning also extends to a branch of research that explores methodological and structural similarities between certain physical systems and learning systems, in particular neural networks. For example, some mathematical and numerical techniques from quantum physics are applicable to classical deep learning and vice versa. Furthermore, researchers investigate more abstract notions of learning theory with respect to quantum information, sometimes referred to as quantum learning theory .",

    "text": "The database schema is the structure of a database described in a formal language supported typically by a relational database management system RDBMS . The term schema refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed divided into database tables in the case of relational databases . The formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas sentences called integrity constraints imposed on a database. These integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts of the schema. All constraints are expressible in the same language. A database can be considered a structure in realization of the database language. The states of a created conceptual schema are transformed into an explicit mapping, the database schema. This describes how real world entities are modeled in the database. A database schema specifies, based on the database administrator s knowledge of possible applications, the facts that can enter the database, or those of interest to the possible end users. The notion of a database schema plays the same role as the notion of theory in predicate calculus. A model of this theory closely corresponds to a database, which can be seen at any instant of time as a mathematical object. Thus a schema can contain formulas representing integrity constraints specifically for an application and the constraints specifically for a type of database, all expressed in the same database language. In a relational database, the schema defines the tables, fields, relationships, views, indexes, packages, procedures, functions, queues, triggers, types, sequences, materialized views, synonyms, database links, directories, XML schemas, and other elements. A database generally stores its schema in a data dictionary. Although a schema is defined in text database language, the term is often used to refer to a graphical depiction of the database structure. In other words, schema is the structure of the database that defines the objects in the database. In an Oracle Database system, the term schema has a slightly different connotation.",

    "title": "Service-oriented architecture",
    "text": "In software engineering, service oriented architecture SOA is an architectural style that focuses on discrete services instead of a monolithic design. SOA is a good choice for system integration. By consequence, it is also applied in the field of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online. SOA is also intended to be independent of vendors, products and technologies. Service orientation is a way of thinking in terms of services and service based development and the outcomes of services. A service has four properties according to one of many definitions of SOA: It logically represents a repeatable business activity with a specified outcome. It is self contained. It is a black box for its consumers, meaning the consumer does not have to be aware of the service s inner workings. It may be composed of other services. Different services can be used in conjunction as a service mesh to provide the functionality of a large software application, a principle SOA shares with modular programming. Service oriented architecture integrates distributed, separately maintained and deployed software components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that facilitate components communication and cooperation over a network, especially over an IP network. SOA is related to the idea of an API application programming interface , an interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software. An API can be thought of as the service, and the SOA the architecture that allows the service to operate. Note that Service Oriented Architecture must not be confused with Service Based Architecture as those are two different architectural styles.",

Most modern development processes can be vaguely described as agile. Other methodologies include waterfall, prototyping, iterative and incremental development, spiral development, rapid application development, and extreme programming. A life cycle model is sometimes considered a more general term for a category of methodologies and a software development process is a particular instance as adopted by a specific organization.

Many software development practices emerged from the agile mindset. These agile based practices, sometimes called Agile with a capital A include requirements, discovery and solutions improvement through the collaborative effort of self organizing and cross functional teams with their customer s end user s .

Thompson s coworker Dennis Ritchie speculated that the name might be based on Bon, an earlier, but unrelated, programming language that Thompson designed for use on Multics. B was designed for recursive, non numeric, machine independent applications, such as system and language software. It was a typeless language, with the only data type being the underlying machine s natural memory word format, whatever that might be. Depending on the context, the word was treated either as an integer or a memory address. As machines with ASCII processing became common, notably the DEC PDP 11 that arrived at Bell Labs, support for character data stuffed in memory words became important. The typeless nature of the language was seen as a disadvantage, which led Thompson and Ritchie to develop an expanded version of the language supporting new internal and user defined types, which became the ubiquitous C programming language.",

In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards face down to the table, instead of speaking them aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates. Planning poker is a variation of the Wideband delphi method. It is most commonly used in agile software development, in particular in Scrum and Extreme Programming. Agile software development methods recommend the use of Planning Poker for estimating the size of user stories and developing release and iteration plans. The method was first defined and named by James Grenning in 2002 and later popularized by Mike Cohn in the book Agile Estimating and Planning, whose company trade marked the term and a digital online tool.",

    "abstract": "Code generation is a core capability of large language models (LLMs), yet\nmainstream benchmarks (e.g., APPs and LiveCodeBench) contain questions with\nmedium-level difficulty and pose no challenge to advanced LLMs. To better\nreflected the advanced reasoning and code generation ability, We introduce\nHumanity's Last Code Exam (HLCE), comprising 235 most challenging problems from\nthe International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC World Finals) and the\nInternational Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) spanning 2010 - 2024. As part of\nHLCE, we design a harmonized online-offline sandbox that guarantees fully\nreproducible evaluation. Through our comprehensive evaluation, we observe that\neven the strongest reasoning LLMs: o4-mini(high) and Gemini-2.5 Pro, achieve\npass@1 rates of only 15.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a\nnovel \"self-recognition\" task to measure LLMs' awareness of their own\ncapabilities. Results indicate that LLMs' self-recognition abilities are not\nproportionally correlated with their code generation performance. Finally, our\nempirical validation of test-time scaling laws reveals that current advanced\nLLMs have substantial room for improvement on complex programming tasks. We\nexpect HLCE to become a milestone challenge for code generation and to catalyze\nadvances in high-performance reasoning and human-AI collaborative programming.\nOur code and dataset are also public\navailable(https://github.com/Humanity-s-Last-Code-Exam/HLCE).",
