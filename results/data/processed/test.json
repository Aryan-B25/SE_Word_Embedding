    "text": "A distributed algorithm is an algorithm designed to run on computer hardware constructed from interconnected processors. Distributed algorithms are used in different application areas of distributed computing, such as telecommunications, scientific computing, distributed information processing, and real time process control. Standard problems solved by distributed algorithms include leader election, consensus, distributed search, spanning tree generation, mutual exclusion, and resource allocation. Distributed algorithms are a sub type of parallel algorithm, typically executed concurrently, with separate parts of the algorithm being run simultaneously on independent processors, and having limited information about what the other parts of the algorithm are doing. One of the major challenges in developing and implementing distributed algorithms is successfully coordinating the behavior of the independent parts of the algorithm in the face of processor failures and unreliable communications links. The choice of an appropriate distributed algorithm to solve a given problem depends on both the characteristics of the problem, and characteristics of the system the algorithm will run on such as the type and probability of processor or link failures, the kind of inter process communication that can be performed, and the level of timing synchronization between separate processes.",

    "text": "Social software engineering SSE is a branch of software engineering that is concerned with the social aspects of software development and the developed software. SSE focuses on the socialness of both software engineering and developed software. On the one hand, the consideration of social factors in software engineering activities, processes and CASE tools is deemed to be useful to improve the quality of both development process and produced software. Examples include the role of situational awareness and multi cultural factors in collaborative software development. On the other hand, the dynamicity of the social contexts in which software could operate e.g., in a cloud environment calls for engineering social adaptability as a runtime iterative activity. Examples include approaches which enable software to gather users quality feedback and use it to adapt autonomously or semi autonomously. SSE studies and builds socially oriented tools to support collaboration and knowledge sharing in software engineering. SSE also investigates the adaptability of software to the dynamic social contexts in which it could operate and the involvement of clients and end users in shaping software adaptation decisions at runtime. Social context includes norms, culture, roles and responsibilities, stakeholder s goals and interdependencies, end users perception of the quality and appropriateness of each software behaviour, etc. The participants of the 1st International Workshop on Social Software Engineering and Applications SoSEA 2008 proposed the following characterization: Community centered: Software is produced and consumed by and or for a community rather than focusing on individuals Collaboration collectiveness: Exploiting the collaborative and collective capacity of human beings Companionship relationship: Making explicit the various associations among people Human social activities: Software is designed consciously to support human activities and to address social problems Social inclusion: Software should enable social inclusion enforcing links and trust in communities Thus, SSE can be defined as the application of processes, methods, and tools to enable community driven creation, management, deployment, and use of software in online environments . One of the main observations in the field of SSE is that the concepts, principles, and technologies made for social software applications are applicable to software development itself as software engineering is inherently a social activity. SSE is not limited to specific activities of software development. Accordingly, tools have been proposed supporting different parts of SSE, for instance, social system design or social requirements engineering. Consequently vertical market software, such as software development tools, engineering tools, marketing tools or software that helps users in a decision making process can profit from social components. Such vertical social software differentiates strongly in its user base from traditional social software such as Yammer.",

Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax form and semantics meaning , usually defined by a formal language. Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and mechanisms for error handling. An implementation of a programming language is required in order to execute programs, namely an interpreter or a compiler. An interpreter directly executes the source code, while a compiler produces an executable program. Computer architecture has strongly influenced the design of programming languages, with the most common type imperative languages which implement operations in a specified order developed to perform well on the popular von Neumann architecture. While early programming languages were closely tied to the hardware, over time they have developed more abstraction to hide implementation details for greater simplicity. Thousands of programming languages often classified as imperative, functional, logic, or object oriented have been developed for a wide variety of uses. Many aspects of programming language design involve tradeoffs for example, exception handling simplifies error handling, but at a performance cost. Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.",

For this article, comment refers to the same concept in a programming language, markup language, configuration file and any similar context. Some development tools, other than a source code translator, do parse comments to provide capabilities such as API document generation, static analysis, and version control integration. The syntax of comments varies by programming language yet there are repeating patterns in the syntax among languages as well as similar aspects related to comment content. The flexibility supported by comments allows for a wide degree of content style variability. To promote uniformity, style conventions are commonly part of a programming style guide.

It allows documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP . The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners Lee while at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1993. It was conceived as a universal linked information system . Documents and other media content are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called uniform resource locators URLs . The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language HTML . This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents, and scripts short programs that implement complex user interaction. The HTML language also supports hyperlinks embedded URLs which provide immediate access to other web resources. Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. Web applications are web pages that function as application software. The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using HTTP. Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name make up a website. A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers. Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations, government agencies, and individual users; and comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government information. The Web has become the world s dominant information systems platform. It is the primary tool that billions of people worldwide use to interact with the Internet.",

Compared to centralized version control, this enables automatic management branching and merging, speeds up most operations except pushing and fetching , improves the ability to work offline, and does not rely on a single location for backups. Git, the world s most popular version control system, is a distributed version control system. In 2010, software development author Joel Spolsky described distributed version control systems as possibly the biggest advance in software development technology in the past ten years .",

It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step by step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging investigating and fixing problems , implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as programs machine code. While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software development is used for this larger overall process with the terms programming, implementation, and coding reserved for the writing and editing of code per se. Sometimes software development is known as software engineering, especially when it employs formal methods or follows an engineering design process.",

Software programmers and architects should use fitness functions to keep their software in check. Although debated, DevOps is characterized by key principles: shared ownership, workflow automation, and rapid feedback. From an academic perspective, Len Bass, Ingo Weber, and Liming Zhu three computer science researchers from the CSIRO and the Software Engineering Institute suggested defining DevOps as a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality . However, the term is used in multiple contexts. At its most successful, DevOps is a combination of specific practices, culture change, and tools.",

    "text": "Design pattern for modeling two competing objects I m trying to figure out the best design pattern to use for managing a competition between two interacting objects. For example, if I want to have a Fox class that chases a Rabbit class through a simple environment. I want to let them compete and find out which one wins. Eventually it would become a teaching tool that students can use to experiment with inheritance and other OO programming skills. Is there an established design patter for this use case? Here s the best I could come up with: one class to represent the environment that hosts both other objects. I m keeping it very simple and assuming the animals only run in straight lines and the fox catches the rabbit if he gets close enough to bite the rabbit. Here is some code demonstrating what I m describing. I used PHP because I can write it quickly, but I don t want to focus on the specifics of the language. My question is really about the design pattern architecture. class Forrest public fox; public rabbit; public width 100; meters? public length 100; construct this gt;fox new Fox ; this gt;rabbit new Rabbit ; this gt;theChase ; public function theChase while ! this gt;rabbit gt;isBitten this gt;rabbit gt;react fox ; this gt;fox gt;react rabbit ; log The fox got the rabbit! ; abstract class Animal public speed; public hasTeeth false; public position; public direction; public isBitten false; public function run distance update coordinates based on direction and speed public function bite someone if isCloseEnough someone amp; amp; this gt;hasTeeth someone gt;isBitten true; log get class this . bit the . get class someone ; the Fox bit the Rabbit public abstract function react someone ; class Rabbit extends Animal construct this gt;speed 30; this gt;position 0,0 ; this gt;direction north ; log get class this . starts at 0,0 ; public react fox avoid the fox class Fox extends Animal construct this gt;speed 20; this gt;position 100,100 ; this gt;direction south ; log get class this . starts at 100,100 ; public react rabbit try to catch the rabbit There are two immediate problems I see with this approach: This architecture results in sequential, alternating actions.

This paper introduces a generalizable approach that\nuses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through\nexplicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with\nsmaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case --\ngiven its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in\ngenerating executable code.

    "text": "Scrum is an agile team collaboration framework commonly used in software development and other industries. Scrum prescribes for teams to break work into goals to be completed within time boxed iterations, called sprints. Each sprint is no longer than one month and commonly lasts two weeks. The scrum team assesses progress in time boxed, stand up meetings of up to 15 minutes, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: one sprint review to demonstrate the work for stakeholders and solicit feedback, and one internal sprint retrospective. A person in charge of a scrum team is typically called a scrum master. Scrum s approach to product development involves bringing decision making authority to an operational level. Unlike a sequential approach to product development, scrum is an iterative and incremental framework for product development. Scrum allows for continuous feedback and flexibility, requiring teams to self organize by encouraging physical co location or close online collaboration, and mandating frequent communication among all team members. The flexible approach of scrum is based in part on the notion of requirement volatility, that stakeholders will change their requirements as the project evolves.",
