[Benchmark here](https://keras.io/getting_started/benchmarks/).\n- **Datacenter-scale training**: Scale confidently from your laptop to large clusters of GPUs or TPUs.\n\nJoin nearly three million developers, from burgeoning startups to global enterprises, in harnessing the power of Keras 3.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install with pip\n\nKeras 3 is available on PyPI as `keras`. Note that Keras 2 remains available as the `tf-keras` package.\n\n1. Install `keras`:\n\n```\npip install keras --upgrade\n```\n\n2. Install backend package(s).\n\nTo use `keras`, you should also install the backend of choice: `tensorflow`, `jax`, or `torch`.\nNote that `tensorflow` is required for using certain Keras 3 features: certain preprocessing layers\nas well as `tf.data` pipelines.\n\n### Local installation\n\n#### Minimal installation\n\nKeras 3 is compatible with Linux and MacOS systems. For Windows users, we recommend using WSL2 to run Keras.\nTo install a local development version:\n\n1. Install dependencies:\n\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n2.

The use of the word esoteric distinguishes them from languages that working developers use to write software. The creators of most esolangs do not intend them to be used for mainstream programming, although some esoteric features, such as live visualization of code, have inspired practical applications in the arts. Such languages are often popular among hackers and hobbyists. Usability is rarely a goal for designers of esoteric programming languages; often their design leads to quite the opposite.

Depending on whether the version control system in use is distributed, like Git or Mercurial, or centralized, like Subversion, CVS, or Perforce, the whole set of information in the repository may be duplicated on every user s system or may be maintained on a single server. Some of the metadata that a repository contains includes, among other things, a historical record of changes in the repository, a set of commit objects, and a set of references to commit objects, called heads. The main purpose of a repository is to store a set of files, as well as the history of changes made to those files. Exactly how each version control system handles storing those changes, however, differs greatly. For instance, Subversion in the past relied on a database instance but has since moved to storing its changes directly on the filesystem. These differences in storage techniques have generally led to diverse uses of version control by different groups, depending on their needs.",

It is one component of software, which also includes documentation and other intangible components. A computer program in its human readable form is called source code. Source code needs another computer program to execute because computers can only execute their native machine instructions. Therefore, source code may be translated to machine instructions using a compiler written for the language. Assembly language programs are translated using an assembler. The resulting file is called an executable. Alternatively, source code may execute within an interpreter written for the language. If the executable is requested for execution, then the operating system loads it into memory and starts a process. The central processing unit will soon switch to this process so it can fetch, decode, and then execute each machine instruction. If the source code is requested for execution, then the operating system loads the corresponding interpreter into memory and starts a process. The interpreter then loads the source code into memory to translate and execute each statement. Running the source code is slower than running an executable. Moreover, the interpreter must be installed on the computer.",

    "text": "A database connection is a facility in computer science that allows client software to talk to database server software, whether on the same machine or not. A connection is required to send commands and receive answers, usually in the form of a result set. Connections are a key concept in data centric programming. Since some DBMS engines require considerable time to connect, connection pooling was invented to improve performance. No command can be performed against a database without an open and available connection to it. Connections are built by supplying an underlying driver or provider with a connection string, which is a way of addressing a specific database or server and instance as well as user authentication credentials for example, Server sql box;Database Common;User ID uid;Pwd password; . Once a connection has been built it can be opened and closed at will, and properties such as the command time out length, or transaction, if one exists can be set. The Connection String is composed of a set of key value pairs as dictated by the data access interface and data provider being used. Many databases such as PostgreSQL only allow one operation to be performed at a time on each connection. If a request for data a SQL Select statement is sent to the database and a result set is returned, the connection is open but not available for other operations until the client finishes consuming the result set. Other databases, like SQL Server 2005 and later , do not impose this limitation. However, databases that provide multiple operations per connection usually incur far more overhead than those that permit only a single operation task at a time.",

    "text": "In computer programming, a callback is a function that is stored as data a reference and designed to be called by another function often back to the original abstraction layer. A function that accepts a callback parameter may be designed to call back before returning to its caller which is known as synchronous or blocking. The function that accepts a callback may be designed to store the callback so that it can be called back after returning which is known as asynchronous, non blocking or deferred. Programming languages support callbacks in different ways such as function pointers, lambda expressions and blocks. A callback can be likened to leaving instructions with a tailor for what to do when a suit is ready, such as calling a specific phone number or delivering it to a given address. These instructions represent a callback: a function provided in advance to be executed later, often by a different part of the system and not necessarily by the one that received it. The term callback can be misleading, as it does not necessarily imply a return to the original caller, unlike a telephone callback. Mesa programming language formalised the callback mechanism used in Programming Languages. By passing a procedure as a parameter, Mesa essentially delegated the execution of that procedure to a later point in time when a specific event occurred, similar to how callbacks are implemented in modern programming languages.",

For example, among creational patterns I found the singleton pattern , but I have also used singleton in my MPV. So my question is: Is a design pattern a over all structure of a product? If yes, then how singleton can be a design pattern? Because I can use it anywhere in my application. Basically, it is restricted only to create one instance at a time in memory, but doesn t this concept define how software is designed? If not, then where are MVP, MVC and MVVM in the three categories of patterns? And what is the difference between design and architecture of software?",

Such data structures are effectively immutable, as their operations do not visibly update the structure in place, but instead always yield a new updated structure. The term was introduced in Driscoll, Sarnak, Sleator, and Tarjan s 1986 article. A data structure is partially persistent if all versions can be accessed but only the newest version can be modified. The data structure is fully persistent if every version can be both accessed and modified. If there is also a meld or merge operation that can create a new version from two previous versions, the data structure is called confluently persistent. Structures that are not persistent are called ephemeral. These types of data structures are particularly common in logical and functional programming, as languages in those paradigms discourage or fully forbid the use of mutable data.",

Software development involves many skills and job specializations including programming, testing, documentation, graphic design, user support, marketing, and fundraising. Software development involves many tools including: compiler, integrated development environment IDE , version control, computer aided software engineering, and word processor. The details of the process used for a development effort vary. The process may be confined to a formal, documented standard, or it can be customized and emergent for the development effort. The process may be sequential, in which each major phase i.e., design, implement, and test is completed before the next begins, but an iterative approach where small aspects are separately designed, implemented, and tested can reduce risk and cost and increase quality.",

    "text": "Software architecture is the set of structures needed to reason about a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations. The architecture of a software system is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building. It functions as the blueprints for the system and the development project, which project management can later use to extrapolate the tasks necessary to be executed by the teams and people involved. Software architecture is about making fundamental structural choices that are costly to change once implemented. Software architecture choices include specific structural options from possibilities in the design of the software. There are two fundamental laws in software architecture: Everything is a trade off Why is more important than how Architectural Kata is a teamwork which can be used to produce an architectural solution that fits the needs. Each team extracts and prioritizes architectural characteristics aka non functional requirements then models the components accordingly. The team can use C4 Model which is a flexible method to model the architecture just enough. Note that synchronous communication between architectural components, entangles them and they must share the same architectural characteristics. Documenting software architecture facilitates communication between stakeholders, captures early decisions about the high level design, and allows the reuse of design components between projects.: 29 35 Software architecture design is commonly juxtaposed with software application design. Whilst application design focuses on the design of the processes and data supporting the required functionality the services offered by the system , software architecture design focuses on designing the infrastructure within which application functionality can be realized and executed such that the functionality is provided in a way which meets the system s non functional requirements. Software architectures can be categorized into two main types: monolith and distributed architecture, each having its own subcategories. Software architecture tends to become more complex over time. Software architects should use fitness functions to continuously keep the architecture in check.",

Because the HTML is pre rendered on a server, this allows for a fast first contentful paint when useful data is first displayed to the user , but there is a period of time afterward where the page appears to be fully loaded and interactive, but is not until the client side JavaScript is executed and event handlers have been attached. Frameworks that use hydration include Next.js and Nuxt.js. React v16.0 introduced a hydrate function, which hydrates an element, in its API.",

Software testing can provide objective, independent information about the quality of software and the risk of its failure to a user or sponsor.

Based on the criteria for measuring correctness from an oracle, software testing employs principles and mechanisms that might recognize a problem. Examples of oracles include specifications, contracts, comparable products, past versions of the same product, inferences about intended or expected purpose, user or customer expectations, relevant standards, and applicable laws. Software testing is often dynamic in nature; running the software to verify actual output matches expected. It can also be static in nature; reviewing code and its associated documentation. Software testing is often used to answer the question: Does the software do what it is supposed to do and what it needs to do? Information learned from software testing may be used to improve the process by which software is developed.: 41 43 Software testing should follow a pyramid approach wherein most of your tests should be unit tests, followed by integration tests and finally end to end e2e tests should have the lowest proportion.",

Along with disciplined agile delivery DAD and SAFe is one of a growing number of frameworks that seek to address the problems encountered when scaling beyond a single team. SAFe promotes alignment, collaboration, and delivery across large numbers of agile teams. It was developed by and for practitioners, by leveraging three primary bodies of knowledge: agile software development, lean product development, and systems thinking. The primary reference for the scaled agile framework was originally the development of a big picture view of how work flowed from product management or other stakeholders , through governance, program, and development teams, out to customers. With the collaboration of others in the agile community, this was progressively refined and then first formally described in a 2007 book. The framework continues to be developed and shared publicly; with an academy and an accreditation scheme supporting those who seek to implement, support, or train others in the adoption of SAFe. Starting at its first release in 2011, six major versions have been released while the latest edition, version 6.0, was released in March 2023. While SAFe continues to be recognised as the most common approach to scaling agile practices at 30 percent and growing ,, it also has received criticism for being too hierarchical and inflexible. It also receives criticism for giving organizations the illusion of adopting Agile, while keeping familiar processes intact.",

The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and preventing security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. Human computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer operated equipment. Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal orientated processes such as problem solving, decision making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.

    "text": "Lisp historically LISP, an abbreviation of list processing is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation. Originally specified in the late 1950s, it is the second oldest high level programming language still in common use, after Fortran. Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best known general purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp, Scheme, Racket, and Clojure. Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by though not originally derived from the notation of Alonzo Church s lambda calculus. It quickly became a favored programming language for artificial intelligence AI research. As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, conditionals, higher order functions, recursion, the self hosting compiler, and the read eval print loop. The name LISP derives from LISt Processor . Linked lists are one of Lisp s major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new domain specific languages embedded in Lisp. The interchangeability of code and data gives Lisp its instantly recognizable syntax. All program code is written as s expressions, or parenthesized lists. A function call or syntactic form is written as a list with the function or operator s name first, and the arguments following; for instance, a function f that takes three arguments would be called as f arg1 arg2 arg3 .",

For instance, a data model may specify that the data element representing a car be composed of a number of other elements which, in turn, represent the color and size of the car and define its owner. The corresponding professional activity is called generally data modeling or, more specifically, database design. Data models are typically specified by a data expert, data specialist, data scientist, data librarian, or a data scholar. A data modeling language and notation are often represented in graphical form as diagrams. A data model can sometimes be referred to as a data structure, especially in the context of programming languages. Data models are often complemented by function models, especially in the context of enterprise models. A data model explicitly determines the structure of data; conversely, structured data is data organized according to an explicit data model or data structure.

Depending on the system under consideration and the technologies employed, the knowledge gained during reverse engineering can help with repurposing obsolete objects, doing security analysis, or learning how something works. Although the process is specific to the object on which it is being performed, all reverse engineering processes consist of three basic steps: information extraction, modeling, and review. Information extraction is the practice of gathering all relevant information for performing the operation. Modeling is the practice of combining the gathered information into an abstract model, which can be used as a guide for designing the new object or system. Review is the testing of the model to ensure the validity of the chosen abstract. Reverse engineering is applicable in the fields of computer engineering, mechanical engineering, design, electrical and electronic engineering, civil engineering, nuclear engineering, aerospace engineering, software engineering, chemical engineering, systems biology and more.",

    "title": "Skeleton (computer programming)",
    "text": "Skeleton programming is a style of computer programming based on simple high level program structures and so called dummy code. Program skeletons resemble pseudocode, but allow parsing, compilation and testing of the code. Dummy code is inserted in a program skeleton to simulate processing and avoid compilation error messages. It may involve empty function declarations, or functions that return a correct result only for a simple test case where the expected response of the code is known. Skeleton programming facilitates a top down design approach, where a partially functional system with complete high level structures is designed and coded, and this system is then progressively expanded to fulfill the requirements of the project. Program skeletons are also sometimes used for high level descriptions of algorithms. A program skeleton may also be utilized as a template that reflects syntax and structures commonly used in a wide class of problems. Skeleton programs are utilized in the template method design pattern used in object oriented programming. In object oriented programming, dummy code corresponds to an abstract method, a method stub or a mock object. In the Java remote method invocation Java RMI nomenclature, a stub communicates on the client side with a skeleton on the server side. A class skeleton is an outline of a class that is used in software engineering. It contains a description of the class s roles, and describes the purposes of the variables and methods, but does not implement them. The class is later implemented from the skeleton. The skeleton can also be known as either an interface or an abstract class, with languages that follow a polymorphic paradigm.",

    "text": "In computer science, an abstract data type ADT is a mathematical model for data types, defined by its behavior semantics from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. This mathematical model contrasts with data structures, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user. For example, a stack has push pop operations that follow a Last In First Out rule, and can be concretely implemented using either a list or an array. Another example is a set which stores values, without any particular order, and no repeated values. Values themselves are not retrieved from sets; rather, one tests a value for membership to obtain a Boolean in or not in . ADTs are a theoretical concept, used in formal semantics and program verification and, less strictly, in the design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, and software systems. Most mainstream computer languages do not directly support formally specifying ADTs. However, various language features correspond to certain aspects of implementing ADTs, and are easily confused with ADTs proper; these include abstract types, opaque data types, protocols, and design by contract. For example, in modular programming, the module declares procedures that correspond to the ADT operations, often with comments that describe the constraints. This information hiding strategy allows the implementation of the module to be changed without disturbing the client programs, but the module only informally defines an ADT. The notion of abstract data types is related to the concept of data abstraction, important in object oriented programming and design by contract methodologies for software engineering.",

    "title": "Inheritance (object-oriented programming)",
    "text": "In object oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object prototype based inheritance or class class based inheritance , retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes sub classes from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes. In most class based object oriented languages like C , an object created through inheritance, a child object , acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent object , with the exception of: constructors, destructors, overloaded operators and friend functions of the base class. Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, to specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors realizing an interface , to reuse code and to independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces. The relationships of objects or classes through inheritance give rise to a directed acyclic graph. An inherited class is called a subclass of its parent class or super class. The term inheritance is loosely used for both class based and prototype based programming, but in narrow use the term is reserved for class based programming one class inherits from another , with the corresponding technique in prototype based programming being instead called delegation one object delegates to another . Class modifying inheritance patterns can be pre defined according to simple network interface parameters such that inter language compatibility is preserved. Inheritance should not be confused with subtyping. In some languages inheritance and subtyping agree, whereas in others they differ; in general, subtyping establishes an is a relationship, whereas inheritance only reuses implementation and establishes a syntactic relationship, not necessarily a semantic relationship inheritance does not ensure behavioral subtyping . To distinguish these concepts, subtyping is sometimes referred to as interface inheritance without acknowledging that the specialization of type variables also induces a subtyping relation , whereas inheritance as defined here is known as implementation inheritance or code inheritance. Still, inheritance is a commonly used mechanism for establishing subtype relationships. Inheritance is contrasted with object composition, where one object contains another object or objects of one class contain objects of another class ; see composition over inheritance. In contrast to subtyping s is a relationship, composition implements a has a relationship. Mathematically speaking, inheritance in any system of classes induces a strict partial order on the set of classes in that system.",

Software testing can provide objective, independent information about the quality of software and the risk of its failure to a user or sponsor. Software testing can determine the correctness of software for specific scenarios but cannot determine correctness for all scenarios. It cannot find all bugs. Based on the criteria for measuring correctness from an oracle, software testing employs principles and mechanisms that might recognize a problem. Examples of oracles include specifications, contracts, comparable products, past versions of the same product, inferences about intended or expected purpose, user or customer expectations, relevant standards, and applicable laws. Software testing is often dynamic in nature; running the software to verify actual output matches expected. It can also be static in nature; reviewing code and its associated documentation. Software testing is often used to answer the question: Does the software do what it is supposed to do and what it needs to do? Information learned from software testing may be used to improve the process by which software is developed.: 41 43 Software testing should follow a pyramid approach wherein most of your tests should be unit tests, followed by integration tests and finally end to end e2e tests should have the lowest proportion.",

    "text": "Java is a high level, general purpose, memory safe, object oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere WORA , meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine JVM regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C , but has fewer low level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities such as reflection and runtime code modification that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then. Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub. Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity. Java was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun s Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL 2.0 only license. Oracle, which bought Sun in 2010, offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine. However, the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM, which is open source software used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions. Java 24 is the version current as of March 2025. Java 8, 11, 17, and 21 are long term support versions still under maintenance.",

This addresses a key bottleneck in supervised learning for structured omics data by increasing annotation throughput without manual curation and human error. Our approach enables the development of virtual cell foundation models capable of downstream tasks such as cell typing and perturbation prediction. As data volume grows, these models may surpass human performance in labeling, paving the way for reliable inference in large scale perturbation screens. This application demonstrates domain specific innovation in health monitoring and diagnostics, aligned with efforts like the Human Cell Atlas and Human Tumor Atlas Network.",

Some points: Only put active user in redis logged in last 30 days If a user is not active for 6 months, and recently logged back and would like to check feeds. There s another service reconstruct data from database and put into redis and serve the user. Store recent feed in redis and only push notification to active subscribers at this time.

When these applications are deployed on multi tier environments that involve browser based clients, web application servers and backend databases, middle tier database caching is used to achieve high scalability and performance. In a three tier architecture, the application software tier and data storage tier can be in different hosts. Throughput of an application can be limited by the network speed. This limitation can be minimized by having the database at the application tier. Because commercial database software makes extensive use of system resources, it is not always practical to have the application and the database at the same host. In this case, a more light weight database application can be used to cache data from the commercial database management system.",

    "text": "Python is a high level, general purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type checked and garbage collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured particularly procedural , object oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library. Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language, and he first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2. Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and it has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.",

    "text": "Dynamic systems development method DSDM is an agile project delivery framework, initially used as a software development method. First released in 1994, DSDM originally sought to provide some discipline to the rapid application development RAD method. In later versions the DSDM Agile Project Framework was revised and became a generic approach to project management and solution delivery rather than being focused specifically on software development and code creation and could be used for non IT projects. The DSDM Agile Project Framework covers a wide range of activities across the whole project lifecycle and includes strong foundations and governance, which set it apart from some other Agile methods. The DSDM Agile Project Framework is an iterative and incremental approach that embraces principles of Agile development, including continuous user customer involvement. DSDM fixes cost, quality and time at the outset and uses the MoSCoW prioritisation of scope into musts, shoulds, coulds and will not haves to adjust the project deliverable to meet the stated time constraint. DSDM is one of a number of agile methods for developing software and non IT solutions, and it forms a part of the Agile Alliance. In 2014, DSDM released the latest version of the method in the DSDM Agile Project Framework . At the same time the new DSDM manual recognised the need to operate alongside other frameworks for service delivery esp. ITIL PRINCE2, Managing Successful Programmes, and PMI. The previous version DSDM 4.2 had only contained guidance on how to use DSDM with extreme programming.",

    "abstract": "Advances in storage technology have introduced Non-Volatile Memory, NVM, as a\nnew storage medium. NVM, along with Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Solid\nState Disk (SSD), and Disk present a system designer with a wide array of\noptions in designing caching middleware. Moreover, design decisions to\nreplicate a data item in more than one level of a caching memory hierarchy may\nenhance the overall system performance with a faster recovery time in the event\nof a memory failure. Given a fixed budget, the key configuration questions are:\nWhich storage media should constitute the memory hierarchy? What is the storage\ncapacity of each hierarchy? Should data be replicated or partitioned across the\ndifferent levels of the hierarchy? We model these cache configuration questions\nas an instance of the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP). This model is\nguided by the specification of each type of memory along with an application's\ndatabase characteristics and its workload. Although MCKP is NP-complete, its\nlinear programming relaxation is efficiently solvable and can be used to\nclosely approximate the optimal solution. We use the resulting simple algorithm\nto evaluate design tradeoffs in the context of a memory hierarchy for a\nKey-Value Store (e.g., memcached) as well as a host-side cache (e.g.,\nFlashcache). The results show selective replication is appropriate with certain\nfailure rates and workload characteristics.

A VPL allows programming with visual expressions, spatial arrangements of text and graphic symbols, used either as elements of syntax or secondary notation. For example, many VPLs are based on the idea of boxes and arrows , where boxes or other screen objects are treated as entities, connected by arrows, lines or arcs which represent relations. VPLs are generally the basis of low code development platforms.",

    "text": "In computer programming and software testing, smoke testing also confidence testing, sanity testing, build verification test BVT and build acceptance test is preliminary testing or sanity testing to reveal simple failures severe enough to, for example, reject a prospective software release. Smoke tests are a subset of test cases that cover the most important functionality of a component or system, used to aid assessment of whether main functions of the software appear to work correctly. When used to determine if a computer program should be subjected to further, more fine grained testing, a smoke test may be called a pretest or an intake test. Alternatively, it is a set of tests run on each new build of a product to verify that the build is testable before the build is released into the hands of the test team. In the DevOps paradigm, use of a build verification test step is one hallmark of the continuous integration maturity stage. For example, a smoke test may address basic questions like does the program run? , does the user interface open? , or does clicking the main button do anything? The process of smoke testing aims to determine whether the application is so badly broken as to make further immediate testing unnecessary. As the book Lessons Learned in Software Testing puts it, smoke tests broadly cover product features in a limited time ... if key features don t work or if key bugs haven t yet been fixed, your team won t waste further time installing or testing . Smoke tests frequently run quickly, giving benefits of faster feedback, rather than running more extensive test suites, which would naturally take longer. Frequent reintegration with smoke testing is among industry best practices. Ideally, every commit to a source code repository should trigger a Continuous Integration build, to identify regressions as soon as possible. If builds take too long, you might batch up several commits into one build, or very large systems might be rebuilt once a day. Overall, rebuild and retest as often as you can. Smoke testing is also done by testers before accepting a build for further testing. Microsoft claims that after code reviews, smoke testing is the most cost effective method for identifying and fixing defects in software . One can perform smoke tests either manually or using an automated tool. In the case of automated tools, the process that generates the build will often initiate the testing. Smoke tests can be functional tests or unit tests. Functional tests exercise the complete program with various inputs. Unit tests exercise individual functions, subroutines, or object methods. Functional tests may comprise a scripted series of program inputs, possibly even with an automated mechanism for controlling mouse movements. Unit tests can be implemented either as separate functions within the code itself, or else as a driver layer that links to the code without altering the code being tested.",

In software testing, the ISTQB defines acceptance testing as: Formal testing with respect to user needs, requirements, and business processes conducted to determine whether a system satisfies the acceptance criteria and to enable the user, customers or other authorized entity to determine whether to accept the system. The final test in the QA lifecycle, user acceptance testing, is conducted just before the final release to assess whether the product or application can handle real world scenarios. By replicating user behavior, it checks if the system satisfies business requirements and rejects changes if certain criteria are not met. Some forms of acceptance testing are, user acceptance testing UAT , end user testing, operational acceptance testing OAT , acceptance test driven development ATDD and field acceptance testing. Acceptance criteria are the criteria that a system or component must satisfy in order to be accepted by a user, customer, or other authorized entity.",

Some ADLs that have been developed are: Acme developed by CMU , AADL standardized by the SAE , C2 developed by UCI , SBC ADL developed by National Sun Yat Sen University , Darwin developed by Imperial College London , and Wright developed by CMU .",

    "text": "Stress testing is a software testing activity that determines the robustness of software by testing beyond the limits of normal operation. Stress testing is particularly important for mission critical software, but is used for all types of software. Stress tests commonly put a greater emphasis on robustness, availability, and error handling under a heavy load, than on what would be considered correct behavior under normal circumstances. A system stress test refers to tests that put a greater emphasis on robustness, availability, and error handling under a heavy load, rather than on what would be considered correct behavior under normal circumstances. In particular, the goals of such tests may be to ensure the software does not crash in conditions of insufficient computational resources such as memory or disk space , unusually high concurrency, or denial of service attacks. Examples: A web server may be stress tested using scripts, bots, and various denial of service tools to observe the performance of a web site during peak loads. These attacks generally are under an hour long, or until a limit in the amount of data that the web server can tolerate is found. Stress testing may be contrasted with load testing: Load testing examines the entire environment and database, while measuring the response time, whereas stress testing focuses on identified transactions, pushing to a level so as to break transactions or systems. During stress testing, if transactions are selectively stressed, the database may not experience much load, but the transactions are heavily stressed. On the other hand, during load testing the database experiences a heavy load, while some transactions may not be stressed. System stress testing, also known as stress testing, is loading the concurrent users over and beyond the level that the system can handle, so it breaks at the weakest link within the entire system.",

    "text": "Asynchrony, in computer programming, refers to the occurrence of events independent of the main program flow and ways to deal with such events. These may be outside events such as the arrival of signals, or actions instigated by a program that take place concurrently with program execution, without the program hanging to wait for results. Asynchronous input output is an example of the latter case of asynchrony, and lets programs issue commands to storage or network devices that service these requests while the processor continues executing the program. Doing so provides a degree of concurrency. A common way for dealing with asynchrony in a programming interface is to provide subroutines that return a future or promise that represents the ongoing operation, and a synchronizing operation that blocks until the future or promise is completed. Some programming languages, such as Cilk, have special syntax for expressing an asynchronous procedure call. Examples of asynchrony include the following: Asynchronous procedure call, a method to run a procedure concurrently, a lightweight alternative to threads. Ajax is a set of client side web technologies used by the client to create asynchronous I O web applications. Asynchronous method dispatch AMD , a data communication method used when there is a need for the server side to handle a large number of long lasting client requests. Using synchronous method dispatch SMD , this scenario may turn the server into an unavailable busy state resulting in a connection failure response caused by a network connection request timeout. The servicing of a client request is immediately dispatched to an available thread from a pool of threads and the client is put in a blocking state. Upon the completion of the task, the server is notified by a callback. The server unblocks the client and transmits the response back to the client. In case of thread starvation, clients are blocked waiting for threads to become available.",

While MLOps started as a set of best practices, it is slowly evolving into an independent approach to ML lifecycle management. MLOps applies to the entire lifecycle from integrating with model generation software development lifecycle, continuous integration continuous delivery , orchestration, and deployment, to health, diagnostics, governance, and business metrics.",

Software architecture patterns operate at a higher level of abstraction than software design patterns, solving broader system level challenges. While these patterns typically affect system level concerns, the distinction between architectural patterns and architectural styles can sometimes be blurry. Examples include Circuit Breaker. Software Architecture Style refers to a high level structural organization that defines the overall system organization, specifying how components are organized, how they interact, and the constraints on those interactions. Architecture styles typically include a vocabulary of component and connector types, as well as semantic models for interpreting the system s properties. These styles represent the most coarse grained level of system organization. Examples include Layered Architecture, Microservices, and Event Driven Architecture.",

    "title": "Database",
    "text": "In computing, a database is an organized collection of data or a type of data store based on the use of a database management system DBMS , the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a database system. Often the term database is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database. Before digital storage and retrieval of data have become widespread, index cards were used for data storage in a wide range of applications and environments: in the home to record and store recipes, shopping lists, contact information and other organizational data; in business to record presentation notes, project research and notes, and contact information; in schools as flash cards or other visual aids; and in academic research to hold data such as bibliographical citations or notes in a card file. Professional book indexers used index cards in the creation of book indexes until they were replaced by indexing software in the 1980s and 1990s. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance. Computer scientists may classify database management systems according to the database models that they support. Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. In the 2000s, non relational databases became popular, collectively referred to as NoSQL, because they use different query languages.",

Following the appearance of The Manifesto for Agile Software Development in 2001, organizations discovered the need for agile technique to spread into other areas of activity, including team and project management. This gave way to the creation of practices that built upon the core principles of Agile software development while engaging with more of the organizational structure, such as the Scaled agile framework SAFe . The term Agile originates from Agile manufacturing which in the early 1990s had developed from flexible manufacturing systems and lean manufacturing production. In 2004, one of the authors of the original manifesto, Jim Highsmith, published Agile Project Management: Creating Innovative Products. The term Agile Project Management has not been picked up by any of the international organizations developing Project Management Standards and as such, Agile management has become common parlance to engage organizations without the formal recognition or institutions to back. The ISO Standard ISO 21502:2020 refers to the term agile as a delivery approach of products project scope . The PMBoK Standard published by the Project Management Institute refers to an adaptive type of development lifecycle also called agile or change driven about the product development lifecycle of a project an element of the project lifecycle .",

    "title": "Data structure alignment",
    "text": "Data structure alignment is the way data is arranged and accessed in computer memory. It consists of three separate but related issues: data alignment, data structure padding, and packing. The CPU in modern computer hardware performs reads and writes to memory most efficiently when the data is naturally aligned, which generally means that the data s memory address is a multiple of the data size. For instance, in a 32 bit architecture, the data may be aligned if the data is stored in four consecutive bytes and the first byte lies on a 4 byte boundary. Data alignment is the aligning of elements according to their natural alignment. To ensure natural alignment, it may be necessary to insert some padding between structure elements or after the last element of a structure. For example, on a 32 bit machine, a data structure containing a 16 bit value followed by a 32 bit value could have 16 bits of padding between the 16 bit value and the 32 bit value to align the 32 bit value on a 32 bit boundary. Alternatively, one can pack the structure, omitting the padding, which may lead to slower access, but uses three quarters as much memory. Although data structure alignment is a fundamental issue for all modern computers, many computer languages and computer language implementations handle data alignment automatically. Fortran, Ada, PL I, Pascal, certain C and C implementations, D, Rust, C , and assembly language allow at least partial control of data structure padding, which may be useful in certain special circumstances.",

We present a design framework and architectural principles to guide future implementations of interactive AI systems that integrate symbolic programming with neural language generation.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of\nfractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time\nsettings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step,\ninput-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for\nlearning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector\nfield, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along\nwith the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to\nestimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are\nthen reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed\napproach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems.\nThe results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the\nsystem dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn\nequivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that\nfractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting\nthe limitations of integer-order representations.",

How best to create high quality software is a separate and controversial problem covering software design principles, so called best practices for writing code, as well as broader management issues such as optimal team size, process, how best to deliver software on time and as quickly as possible, work place culture , hiring practices, and so forth.

    "text": "In software engineering, a software design pattern or design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in many contexts in software design. A design pattern is not a rigid structure to be transplanted directly into source code. Rather, it is a description or a template for solving a particular type of problem that can be deployed in many different situations. Design patterns can be viewed as formalized best practices that the programmer may use to solve common problems when designing a software application or system. Object oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages. Some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non object oriented languages. Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.",

To support\nthis process, we define a metamodel capable of representing the core elements\nof object-oriented languages.

While DataOps began as a set of best practices, it has now matured to become a new and independent approach to data analytics. DataOps applies to the entire data lifecycle from data preparation to reporting, and recognizes the interconnected nature of the data analytics team and information technology operations. DataOps incorporates the Agile methodology to shorten the cycle time of analytics development in alignment with business goals. DevOps focuses on continuous delivery by leveraging on demand IT resources and by automating test and deployment of software. This merging of software development and IT operations has improved velocity, quality, predictability and scale of software engineering and deployment. Borrowing methods from DevOps, DataOps seeks to bring these same improvements to data analytics. DataOps utilizes statistical process control SPC to monitor and control the data analytics pipeline. With SPC in place, the data flowing through an operational system is constantly monitored and verified to be working. If an anomaly occurs, the data analytics team can be notified through an automated alert. DataOps is not tied to a particular technology, architecture, tool, language or framework. Tools that support DataOps promote collaboration, orchestration, quality, security, access and ease of use.",

Application or user specific database objects in relational databases are usually created with data definition language DDL commands, which in SQL for example can be CREATE, ALTER and DROP.

Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms such as search and merge algorithms that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human readable output. Formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions: The output is in monotonic order each element is no smaller larger than the previous element, according to the required order . The output is a permutation a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements of the input. Although some algorithms are designed for sequential access, the highest performing algorithms assume data is stored in a data structure which allows random access.",

    "text": "In software systems, encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the mechanisms or methods that operate on the data. It may also refer to the limiting of direct access to some of that data, such as an object s components. Essentially, encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object. Encapsulation allows developers to present a consistent interface that is independent of its internal implementation. As one example, encapsulation can be used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class. This prevents clients from directly accessing this information in a way that could expose hidden implementation details or violate state invariance maintained by the methods. Encapsulation also encourages programmers to put all the code that is concerned with a certain set of data in the same class, which organizes it for easy comprehension by other programmers. Encapsulation is a technique that encourages decoupling. All object oriented programming OOP systems support encapsulation, but encapsulation is not unique to OOP. Implementations of abstract data types, modules, and libraries also offer encapsulation. The similarity has been explained by programming language theorists in terms of existential types.",

The process is more encompassing than programming, writing code, in that it includes conceiving the goal, evaluating feasibility, analyzing requirements, design, testing and release. The process is part of software engineering which also includes organizational management, project management, configuration management and other aspects. Software development involves many skills and job specializations including programming, testing, documentation, graphic design, user support, marketing, and fundraising. Software development involves many tools including: compiler, integrated development environment IDE , version control, computer aided software engineering, and word processor. The details of the process used for a development effort vary. The process may be confined to a formal, documented standard, or it can be customized and emergent for the development effort. The process may be sequential, in which each major phase i.e., design, implement, and test is completed before the next begins, but an iterative approach where small aspects are separately designed, implemented, and tested can reduce risk and cost and increase quality.",

    "title": "Penetration test",
    "text": "A penetration test, colloquially known as a pentest, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system; this is not to be confused with a vulnerability assessment. The test is performed to identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities , including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system s features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed. The process typically identifies the target systems and a particular goal, then reviews available information and undertakes various means to attain that goal. A penetration test target may be a white box about which background and system information are provided in advance to the tester or a black box about which only basic information other than the company name is provided . A gray box penetration test is a combination of the two where limited knowledge of the target is shared with the auditor . A penetration test can help identify a system s vulnerabilities to attack and estimate how vulnerable it is. Security issues that the penetration test uncovers should be reported to the system owner. Penetration test reports may also assess potential impacts to the organization and suggest countermeasures to reduce the risk. The UK National Cyber Security Center describes penetration testing as: A method for gaining assurance in the security of an IT system by attempting to breach some or all of that system s security, using the same tools and techniques as an adversary might. The goals of a penetration test vary depending on the type of approved activity for any given engagement, with the primary goal focused on finding vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a nefarious actor, and informing the client of those vulnerabilities along with recommended mitigation strategies. Penetration tests are a component of a full security audit. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requires penetration testing on a regular schedule, and after system changes. Penetration testing also can support risk assessments as outlined in the NIST Risk Management Framework SP 800 53. Several standard frameworks and methodologies exist for conducting penetration tests. These include the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual OSSTMM , the Penetration Testing Execution Standard PTES , the NIST Special Publication 800 115, the Information System Security Assessment Framework ISSAF and the OWASP Testing Guide. CREST, a not for profit professional body for the technical cyber security industry, provides its CREST Defensible Penetration Test standard that provides the industry with guidance for commercially reasonable assurance activity when carrying out penetration tests. Flaw hypothesis methodology is a systems analysis and penetration prediction technique where a list of hypothesized flaws in a software system are compiled through analysis of the specifications and documentation for the system. The list of hypothesized flaws is then prioritized on the basis of the estimated probability that a flaw actually exists, and on the ease of exploiting it to the extent of control or compromise. The prioritized list is used to direct the actual testing of the system. There are different types of penetration testing, depending upon the goal of the organization which include: Network external and internal , Wireless, Web Application, Social Engineering, and Remediation Verification. Even more recently a common pen testing tool called a flipper was used to hack the MGM casinos in 2023 by a group called Scattered Spiders showing the versatility and power of some of the tools of the trade.",

    "title": "Software testing outsourcing",
    "text": "Software Testing Outsourcing is software testing carried out by an independent company or a group of people not directly involved in the process of software development. Software testing is an essential phase of software development. However, it is often viewed as a non core activity for most organizations. Outsourcing enables an organization to concentrate on its core development activities while external software testing experts handle the independent validation work. This offers many business benefits, which include independent assessment leading to enhanced delivery confidence, reduced time to market, lower infrastructure investment, predictable software quality, de risking of deadlines, and increased time to focus on development. Software Testing Outsourcing can come in different forms: Full outsourcing, insourcing or remote insourcing of the entire test process strategy, planning, execution, and closure , often referred to as a Managed Testing Service or dedicated testing teams. Provision of additional resources for major projects One off tests often related to loading, stress or performance testing Beta User Acceptance Testing. Utilizing specialist focus groups coordinated by an external organization Software Testing Outsourcing is utilized when a company does not have the resources or capabilities in house to address testing needs. Outsourcing can be given to organizations with expertise in many areas, including testing software for the web, mobile, printing, or even Fax performance. Testing companies can provide outsourcing services located in the home country of business or many other onshore or offshore sites. A testing partner could mean someone in the same city or another city across the country. It could also mean onshore but rurally sourced. Near shore options are located in the same time zone but cheaper markets like Mexico, while offshore testing usually takes place in countries like the Caribbean, Ukraine, and India. Onshore testing Software testing companies based in the US and typically include Canada. Onshore often refers to your home country. Offshore testing Software testing companies in a country other than your home country. Near shore Software testing companies located outside of the home country but in the same or similar time zone. Software testing offshore is considered more ideal when pricing is a key factor and when the task is simple enough for lesser experienced staff with limited direction. Offshore is also a more common choice when there can be tight coordination and time zone overlap is not an impediment. If the testing is more complicated and requires focused coordination and frequent interfacing with internal teams, onshore services will be more critical. Security and cultural alignment are also important factors that are most often satisfied by an onshore partner. Pros of Software Testing Outsourcing Onshore: On hand information: Fluid and first hand information from throughout the process. Face to face communication: enables on time detection of emerging issues and efficient problem solving. Effective communication: With no time and distance gap or cultural differences, there are almost no misunderstandings within teams. Time effectiveness: Real time work model with no time zone delays ensures efficiencies. Enhanced Time to market: Based on all of the above, speed to market is guaranteed. Pros of Software Testing Outsourcing Offshore: Best choice for long term projects: The results are typical but not proven. Low costs: The cost of IT projects can be cheaper when outsourced to countries with low labor costs. Round the clock support: Typically, offshore testing companies offer 24 7 support services. Fast Scalability: Access to a large pool of resources capable of fast test activation. Hybrid: Software Testing Outsourcing Offshore in execution with Onshore Over site Some companies offer an onshore, local project lead to oversee an offshore outsourced team. Advantages of Onsite Offshore Outsourced Testing Model If used right, this model can ensure that there is work going on every minute of the 24 hours on a project. Direct client interaction helps in better communication and also improves the business relationship. Cost effective Offshore teams cost less than setting up the entire QA team onsite. Considerations of the time zone differences and manage expectations accordingly.",

Among Web professionals, Web development usually refers to the main non design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems CMS to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills. For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people Web developers and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front end developer, back end developer, and full stack developer. Front end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back end developers deal with the servers.

    "abstract": "Modern large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as agents, calling\nexternal tools adaptively to solve tasks. Rather than directly calling tools,\nit can be more effective for LLMs to write code to perform the tool calls,\nenabling them to automatically generate complex control flow such as\nconditionals and loops. Such code actions are typically provided as Python\ncode, since LLMs are quite proficient at it; however, Python may not be the\nideal language due to limited built-in support for performance, security, and\nreliability. We propose a novel programming language for code actions, called\nQuasar, which has several benefits: (1) automated parallelization to improve\nperformance, (2) uncertainty quantification to improve reliability and mitigate\nhallucinations, and (3) security features enabling the user to validate\nactions. LLMs can write code in a subset of Python, which is automatically\ntranspiled to Quasar. We evaluate our approach on the ViperGPT visual question\nanswering agent, applied to the GQA dataset, demonstrating that LLMs with\nQuasar actions instead of Python actions retain strong performance, while\nreducing execution time when possible by 42%, improving security by reducing\nuser approval interactions when possible by 52%, and improving reliability by\napplying conformal prediction to achieve a desired target coverage level.",

    "title": "Dynamic web page",
    "text": "A dynamic web page is a web page constructed at runtime during software execution , as opposed to a static web page, delivered as it is stored. A server side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server side scripts. In server side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, and including the setting up of more client side processing. A client side dynamic web page processes the web page using JavaScript running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript can interact with the page via Document Object Model DOM , to query page state and modify it. Even though a web page can be dynamic on the client side, it can still be hosted on a static hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 as long as there is not any server side code included. A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a computer program to change some variable content. The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page s DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a dynamic web page update using AJAX technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the web browsing history forward of the displayed page. Using AJAX, the end user gets one dynamic page managed as a single page in the web browser while the actual web content rendered on that page can vary. The AJAX engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, the DOM, for its client, from an application server. A particular application server could offer a standardized REST style interface to offer services to the web application. DHTML is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not static web pages, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of AJAX, a term which is now itself rarely used. Client side scripting, server side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.",

Database refactoring does not change the way data is interpreted or used and does not fix bugs or add new functionality. Every refactoring to a database leaves the system in a working state, thus not causing maintenance lags, provided the meaningful data exists in the production environment. A database refactoring is conceptually more difficult than a code refactoring; code refactorings only need to maintain behavioral semantics while database refactorings also must maintain informational semantics. A database schema is typically refactored for one of several reasons: To develop the schema in an evolutionary manner in parallel with the evolutionary design of the rest of the system. To fix design problems with an existing legacy database schema. Database refactorings are often motivated by the desire for database normalization of an existing production database, typically to clean up the design of the database. To implement what would be a large and potentially risky change as a series of small, low risk changes.",

    "title": "Programming language",
    "text": "A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs. Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax form and semantics meaning , usually defined by a formal language. Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and mechanisms for error handling. An implementation of a programming language is required in order to execute programs, namely an interpreter or a compiler. An interpreter directly executes the source code, while a compiler produces an executable program. Computer architecture has strongly influenced the design of programming languages, with the most common type imperative languages which implement operations in a specified order developed to perform well on the popular von Neumann architecture. While early programming languages were closely tied to the hardware, over time they have developed more abstraction to hide implementation details for greater simplicity. Thousands of programming languages often classified as imperative, functional, logic, or object oriented have been developed for a wide variety of uses. Many aspects of programming language design involve tradeoffs for example, exception handling simplifies error handling, but at a performance cost. Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.",

My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache , but that s silly because the array was just generated. What is going on? Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array? The code is summing up some independent terms, so the order should not matter. Related follow up Q amp;As with more modern C compilers Why is processing an unsorted array the same speed as processing a sorted array with modern x86 64 clang? modern C compilers auto vectorize the loop , especially when SSE4.1 or AVX2 is available. This avoids any data dependent branching so performance isn t data dependent. gcc optimization flag O3 makes code slower than O2 branchless scalar with cmov can result in a longer dependency chain especially when GCC chooses poorly , creating a latency bottleneck that makes it slower than branchy asm for the sorted case.",

The history of software is closely tied to the development of digital computers in the mid 20th century. Early programs were written in the machine language specific to the hardware. The introduction of high level programming languages in 1958 allowed for more human readable instructions, making software development easier and more portable across different computer architectures. Software in a programming language is run through a compiler or interpreter to execute on the architecture s hardware. Over time, software has become complex, owing to developments in networking, operating systems, and databases. Software can generally be categorized into two main types: operating systems, which manage hardware resources and provide services for applications application software, which performs specific tasks for users The rise of cloud computing has introduced the new software delivery model Software as a Service SaaS . In SaaS, applications are hosted by a provider and accessed over the Internet. The process of developing software involves several stages. The stages include software design, programming, testing, release, and maintenance.

    "text": "In software engineering, multitier architecture often referred to as n tier architecture is a client server architecture in which presentation, application processing and data management functions are physically separated. The most widespread use of multitier architecture is the three tier architecture for example, Cisco s Hierarchical internetworking model . N tier application architecture provides a model by which developers can create flexible and reusable applications. By segregating an application into tiers, developers acquire the option of modifying or adding a specific tier, instead of reworking the entire application. N tier architecture is a good fit for small and simple applications because of its simplicity and low cost. Also, it can be a good starting point when architectural requirements are not clear yet. A three tier architecture is typically composed of a presentation tier, a logic tier, and a data tier. While the concepts of layer and tier are often used interchangeably, one fairly common point of view is that there is indeed a difference. This view holds that a layer is a logical structuring mechanism for the conceptual elements that make up the software solution, while a tier is a physical structuring mechanism for the hardware elements that make up the system infrastructure. For example, a three layer solution could easily be deployed on a single tier, such in the case of an extreme database centric architecture called RDBMS only architecture or in a personal workstation.",

High quality labeled training datasets for supervised and semi supervised machine learning algorithms are usually difficult and expensive to produce because of the large amount of time needed to label the data. Although they do not need to be labeled, high quality datasets for unsupervised learning can also be difficult and costly to produce. Many organizations, including governments, publish and share their datasets. The datasets are classified, based on the licenses, as Open data and Non Open data. The datasets from various governmental bodies are presented in List of open government data sites. The datasets are ported on open data portals.

    "text": "The software release life cycle is the process of developing, testing, and distributing a software product e.g., an operating system . It typically consists of several stages, such as pre alpha, alpha, beta, and release candidate, before the final version, or gold , is released to the public. Pre alpha refers to the early stages of development, when the software is still being designed and built. Alpha testing is the first phase of formal testing, during which the software is tested internally using white box techniques. Beta testing is the next phase, in which the software is tested by a larger group of users, typically outside of the organization that developed it. The beta phase is focused on reducing impacts on users and may include usability testing. After beta testing, the software may go through one or more release candidate phases, in which it is refined and tested further, before the final version is released. Some software, particularly in the internet and technology industries, is released in a perpetual beta state, meaning that it is continuously being updated and improved, and is never considered to be a fully completed product. This approach allows for a more agile development process and enables the software to be released and used by users earlier in the development cycle.",

Judicious application can reduce the cost of developing and maintaining software, while increasing its quality and reliability. Callable units are present at multiple levels of abstraction in the programming environment. For example, a programmer may write a function in source code that is compiled to machine code that implements similar semantics. There is a callable unit in the source code and an associated one in the machine code, but they are different kinds of callable units with different implications and features.",

    "text": "The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to web design and web development, two very related fields: Web design field that encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardized code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front end client side design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines. Web development work involved in developing a web site for the Internet World Wide Web or an intranet a private network . Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web based internet applications web apps , electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client side server side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e commerce development. Among web professionals, web development usually refers to the main non design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems CMS to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills. For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds of people web developers and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front end developer, back end developer, and full stack developer. Front end developers are responsible for behaviour and visuals that run in the user browser, back end developers deal with the servers and full stack developers are responsible for both. Currently, the demand for React and Node.JS developers are very high all over the world.",
