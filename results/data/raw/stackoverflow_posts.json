    "title": "Image Processing: Algorithm Improvement for &#39;Coca-Cola Can&#39; Recognition",
    "body": "<p>One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing\" rel=\"noreferrer\">image processing</a>. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola <strong>'cans'</strong> (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the <em>green rectangle</em> with scale and rotation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/irQtR.png\" alt=\"Template matching\" /></p>\n<p>Some constraints on the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The background could be very noisy.</li>\n<li>The <em>can</em> could have any <em>scale</em> or <em>rotation</em> or even orientation (within reasonable limits).</li>\n<li>The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).</li>\n<li>There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the <em>can</em>!</li>\n<li>The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely &quot;too much&quot; on color detection).</li>\n<li>The <em>can</em> could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.</li>\n<li>There could be no <em>can</em> at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Byw82.png\" alt=\"Total fail\" /></p>\n<p>I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:</p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong>: Done in C++ using <a href=\"http://opencv.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OpenCV</a> library.</p>\n<p><strong>Pre-processing</strong>: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Changing color domain from RGB to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV\" rel=\"noreferrer\">HSV</a> and filtering based on &quot;red&quot; hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ktdAB.png\" alt=\"Binarized image\" /></li>\n<li>Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.</li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Canny Edge Detection Filter</a> to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/F9319.png\" alt=\"Contour detection\" /></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Algorithm</strong>: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0123725380\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> awesome book on feature extraction and called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_Hough_transform\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Generalized Hough Transform</a> (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).</li>\n<li>It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.</li>\n<li>It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will &quot;learn&quot;.</li>\n<li>Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wxrT1.png\" alt=\"GHT\" /></p>\n<p>Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template).

    "text": "Image Processing: Algorithm Improvement for &#39;Coca-Cola Can&#39; Recognition <p>One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing\" rel=\"noreferrer\">image processing</a>. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola <strong>'cans'</strong> (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the <em>green rectangle</em> with scale and rotation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/irQtR.png\" alt=\"Template matching\" /></p>\n<p>Some constraints on the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The background could be very noisy.</li>\n<li>The <em>can</em> could have any <em>scale</em> or <em>rotation</em> or even orientation (within reasonable limits).</li>\n<li>The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).</li>\n<li>There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the <em>can</em>!</li>\n<li>The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely &quot;too much&quot; on color detection).</li>\n<li>The <em>can</em> could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.</li>\n<li>There could be no <em>can</em> at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Byw82.png\" alt=\"Total fail\" /></p>\n<p>I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:</p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong>: Done in C++ using <a href=\"http://opencv.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OpenCV</a> library.</p>\n<p><strong>Pre-processing</strong>: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Changing color domain from RGB to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV\" rel=\"noreferrer\">HSV</a> and filtering based on &quot;red&quot; hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ktdAB.png\" alt=\"Binarized image\" /></li>\n<li>Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.</li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Canny Edge Detection Filter</a> to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/F9319.png\" alt=\"Contour detection\" /></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Algorithm</strong>: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0123725380\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> awesome book on feature extraction and called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_Hough_transform\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Generalized Hough Transform</a> (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).</li>\n<li>It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.</li>\n<li>It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will &quot;learn&quot;.</li>\n<li>Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wxrT1.png\" alt=\"GHT\" /></p>\n<p>Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...</p>\n<p><strong>Results</strong>: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is <strong>extremely slow</strong>!

Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag.

ParentId = 0 is the convention to express \"these are top level\". The Order column defines how nodes with the same parent are going to be sorted.</p>\n\n<p>The \"result set\" I spoke of can be pictured as an array of hashmaps (to stay in that terminology). For my example was meant to be already there. Some answers go the extra mile and construct it first, but thats okay.</p>\n\n<p>The tree can be arbitrarily deep. Each node can have N children. I did not exactly have a \"millions of entries\" tree in mind, though.</p>\n\n<p>Don't mistake my choice of node naming ('Node 1.1.1') for something to rely on. The nodes could equally well be called 'Frank' or 'Bob', no naming structure is implied, this was merely to make it readable.</p>\n\n<p><em>I have posted my own solution so you guys can pull it to pieces.</em></p>\n",

What is the fastest way to sort an array of 6 integers?</p>\n\n<p>As the question is very low level:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>we can't assume libraries are available (and the call itself has its cost), only plain C</li>\n<li>to avoid emptying instruction pipeline (that has a <em>very</em> high cost) we should probably minimize branches, jumps, and every other kind of control flow breaking (like those hidden behind sequence points in <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code>).</li>\n<li>room is constrained and minimizing registers and memory use is an issue, ideally in place sort is probably best.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Really this question is a kind of Golf where the goal is not to minimize source length but execution time. I call it 'Zening' code as used in the title of the book <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1883577039\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zen of Code optimization</a> by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Abrash\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Michael Abrash</a> and its <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/02/there-aint-no-such-thing-as-the-fastest-code.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sequels</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As for why it is interesting, there is several layers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the example is simple and easy to understand and measure, not much C skill involved</li>\n<li>it shows effects of choice of a good algorithm for the problem, but also effects of the compiler and underlying hardware.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here is my reference (naive, not optimized) implementation and my test set.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nstatic __inline__ int sort6(int * d){\n\n    char j, i, imin;\n    int tmp;\n    for (j = 0 ; j &lt; 5 ; j++){\n        imin = j;\n        for (i = j + 1; i &lt; 6 ; i++){\n            if (d[i] &lt; d[imin]){\n                imin = i;\n            }\n        }\n        tmp = d[j];\n        d[j] = d[imin];\n        d[imin] = tmp;\n    }\n}\n\nstatic __inline__ unsigned long long rdtsc(void)\n{\n  unsigned long long int x;\n     __asm__ volatile (\".byte 0x0f, 0x31\" : \"=A\" (x));\n     return x;\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char ** argv){\n    int i;\n    int d[6][5] = {\n        {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6},\n        {6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1},\n        {100, 2, 300, 4, 500, 6},\n        {100, 2, 3, 4, 500, 6},\n        {1, 200, 3, 4, 5, 600},\n        {1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1}\n    };\n\n    unsigned long long cycles = rdtsc();\n    for (i = 0; i &lt; 6 ; i++){\n        sort6(d[i]);\n        /*\n         * printf(\"d%d : %d %d %d %d %d %d\\n\", i,\n         *  d[i][0], d[i][6], d[i][7],\n         *  d[i][8], d[i][9], d[i][10]);\n        */\n    }\n    cycles = rdtsc() - cycles;\n    printf(\"Time is %d\\n\", (unsigned)cycles);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2><strong>Raw results</strong></h2>\n\n<p>As number of variants is becoming large, I gathered them all in a test suite that can be found <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/azzuk072\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.

Parameter passing ? Fast max ?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sorting Networks 12 SWAP with Fast Swap</strong></p>\n\n<p>As suggested by Daniel Stutzbach, I combined his 12 swap sorting network with branchless fast swap (code is <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/azzuk072\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>). It is indeed faster, the best so far with a small margin (roughly 5%) as could be expected using 1 less swap. </p>\n\n<p>It is also interesting to notice that the branchless swap seems to be much (4 times) less efficient than the simple one using if on PPC architecture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Calling Library qsort</strong></p>\n\n<p>To give another reference point I also tried as suggested to just call library qsort (code is <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/azzuk072\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>). As expected it is much slower : 10 to 30 times slower...  as it became obvious with the new test suite, the main problem seems to be the initial load of the library after the first call, and it compares not so poorly with other version. It is just between 3 and 20 times slower on my Linux. On some architecture used for tests by others it seems even to be faster (I'm really surprised by that one, as library qsort use a more complex API).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rank order</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rex Kerr proposed another completely different method : for each item of the array compute directly its final position. This is efficient because computing rank order do not need branch. The drawback of this method is that it takes three times the amount of memory of the array (one copy of array and variables to store rank orders). The performance results are very surprising (and interesting). On my reference architecture with 32 bits OS and Intel Core2 Quad E8300, cycle count was slightly below 1000 (like sorting networks with branching swap). But when compiled and executed on my 64 bits box (Intel Core2 Duo) it performed much better : it became the fastest so far. I finally found out the true reason. My 32bits box use gcc 4.4.1 and my 64bits box gcc 4.4.3 and the last one seems much better at optimizing this particular code (there was very little difference for other proposals).</p>\n\n<p><em>update</em>:</p>\n\n<p>As published figures above shows this effect was still enhanced by later versions of gcc and Rank Order became consistently twice as fast as any other alternative.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sorting Networks 12 with reordered Swap</strong></p>\n\n<p>The amazing efficiency of the Rex Kerr proposal with gcc 4.4.3 made me wonder : how could a program with 3 times as much memory usage be faster than branchless sorting networks? My hypothesis was that it had less dependencies of the kind read after write, allowing for better use of the superscalar instruction scheduler of the x86. That gave me an idea: reorder swaps to minimize read after write dependencies. More simply put: when you do <code>SWAP(1, 2); SWAP(0, 2);</code> you have to wait for the first swap to be finished before performing the second one because both access to a common memory cell. When you do <code>SWAP(1, 2); SWAP(4, 5);</code>the processor can execute both in parallel. I tried it and it works as expected, the sorting networks is running about 10% faster. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Sorting Networks 12 with Simple Swap</strong></p>\n\n<p>One year after the original post Steinar H. Gunderson suggested, that we should not try to outsmart the compiler and keep the swap code simple. It's indeed a good idea as the resulting code is about 40% faster! He also proposed a swap optimized by hand using x86 inline assembly code that can still spare some more cycles. The most surprising (it says volumes on programmer's psychology) is that one year ago none of used tried that version of swap. Code I used to test is <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/azzuk072\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. Others suggested other ways to write a C fast swap, but it yields the same performances as the simple one with a decent compiler.</p>\n\n<p>The \"best\" code is now as follow:</p>\n\n<pre><code>static inline void sort6_sorting_network_simple_swap(int * d){\n#define min(x, y) (x&lt;y?x:y)\n#define max(x, y) (x&lt;y?y:x) \n#define SWAP(x,y) { const int a = min(d[x], d[y]); \\\n                    const int b = max(d[x], d[y]); \\\n                    d[x] = a; d[y] = b; }\n    SWAP(1, 2);\n    SWAP(4, 5);\n    SWAP(0, 2);\n    SWAP(3, 5);\n    SWAP(0, 1);\n    SWAP(3, 4);\n    SWAP(1, 4);\n    SWAP(0, 3);\n    SWAP(2, 5);\n    SWAP(1, 3);\n    SWAP(2, 4);\n    SWAP(2, 3);\n#undef SWAP\n#undef min\n#undef max\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we believe our test set (and, yes it is quite poor, it's mere benefit is being short, simple and easy to understand what we are measuring), the average number of cycles of the resulting code for one sort is below 40 cycles (6 tests are executed). That put each swap at an average of 4 cycles. I call that amazingly fast. Any other improvements possible ?</p>\n",

But the problem is, certain combinations of layer size (say, 1000), minibatch size, and learning rate give rise to <code>NaN</code> values in the computations. After some inspection, I see that extremely small values (order of <code>1e-100</code>) eventually appear in the activations. But, even when that doesn't happen, the training still doesn't work. There's no improvement over its loss or accuracy.</p>\n<p>I checked and rechecked my code, and I'm at a loss as to what the root of the problem could be.</p>\n<p>Here's the backpropagation training, which computes the deltas for each layer:</p>\n<pre><code>backward lf n (out,tar) das = do\n    let δout = tr (derivate lf (tar, out)) -- dE/dy\n        deltas = scanr (\\(l, a') δ -&gt;\n                         let w = weights l\n                         in (tr a') * (w &lt;&gt; δ)) δout (zip (tail $ toList n) das)\n    return (deltas)\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>lf</code> is the loss function, <code>n</code> is the network (<code>weight</code> matrix and <code>bias</code> vector for each layer), <code>out</code> and <code>tar</code> are the actual output of the network and the <code>target</code> (desired) output, and <code>das</code> are the activation derivatives of each layer.</p>\n<p>In batch mode, <code>out</code>, <code>tar</code> are matrices (rows are output vectors), and <code>das</code> is a list of the matrices.</p>\n<p>Here's the actual gradient computation:</p>\n<pre><code>  grad lf (n, (i,t)) = do\n    -- Forward propagation: compute layers outputs and activation derivatives\n    let (as, as') = unzip $ runLayers n i\n        (out) = last as\n    (ds) &lt;- backward lf n (out, t) (init as') -- Compute deltas with backpropagation\n    let r  = fromIntegral $ rows i -- Size of minibatch\n    let gs = zipWith (\\δ a -&gt; tr (δ &lt;&gt; a)) ds (i:init as) -- Gradients for weights\n    return $ GradBatch ((recip r .*) &lt;$&gt; gs, (recip r .*) &lt;$&gt; squeeze &lt;$&gt; ds)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, <code>lf</code> and <code>n</code> are the same as above, <code>i</code> is the input, and <code>t</code> is the target output (both in batch form, as matrices).</p>\n<p><code>squeeze</code> transforms a matrix into a vector by summing over each row. That is, <code>ds</code> is a list of matrices of deltas, where each column corresponds to the deltas for a row of the minibatch. So, the gradients for the biases are the average of the deltas over all the minibatch. The same thing for <code>gs</code>, which corresponds to the gradients for the weights.</p>\n<p>Here's the actual update code:</p>\n<pre><code>move lr (n, (i,t)) (GradBatch (gs, ds)) = do\n    -- Update function\n    let update = (\\(FC w b af) g δ -&gt; FC (w + (lr).*g) (b + (lr).*δ) af)\n        n' = Network.fromList $ zipWith3 update (Network.toList n) gs ds\n    return (n', (i,t))\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>lr</code> is the learning rate. <code>FC</code> is the layer constructor, and <code>af</code> is the activation function for that layer.</p>\n<p>The gradient descent algorithm makes sure to pass in a negative value for the learning rate. The actual code for the gradient descent is simply a loop around a composition of <code>grad</code> and <code>move</code>, with a parameterized stop condition.</p>\n<p>Finally, here's the code for a mean square error loss function:</p>\n<pre><code>mse :: (Floating a) =&gt; LossFunction a a\nmse = let f (y,y') = let gamma = y'-y in gamma**2 / 2\n          f' (y,y') = (y'-y)\n      in  Evaluator f f'\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>Evaluator</code> just bundles a loss function and its derivative (for calculating the delta of the output layer).</p>\n<p>The rest of the code is up on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/DrPyser/NeuralNetwork\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">NeuralNetwork</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyone has an insight into the problem, or even just a sanity check that I'm correctly implementing the algorithm?</p>\n",

My first instinct is to read the image in pixel by pixel and store it in a list (array) of boolean values: <code>True</code> for a white pixel, and <code>False</code> for a non-white pixel (the colours can be discarded). The issue with this method, is that the image may not be \"pixel perfect\".

This way, the paths could be read into the same sort of list (boolean values) where <code>True</code> indicates a path or wall, <code>False</code> indicating a travel-able space. An issue with this method arises if the conversion is not 100% accurate, and does not fully connect all of the walls, creating gaps.</p>\n\n<p>Also an issue with converting to SVG is that the lines are not \"perfectly\" straight.

Likewise, you can retrieve just the <em>'keys'</em> or just the <em>'values'</em> by: </p>\n\n<pre><code>names(x)    # fetch just the 'keys' of an R list\n# [1] \"ev1\" \"ev2\" \"rv\"\n\nunlist(x)   # fetch just the 'values' of an R list\n#   ev1       ev2        rv \n#  \"10\"      \"15\" \"Group 1\" \n\nx = list(\"a\"=6, \"b\"=9, \"c\"=3)  \n\nsum(unlist(x))\n# [1] 18\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but R <code>list</code>s are also <strong><em>unlike</em></strong> other map-type ADTs (from among the languages I've learned anyway). My guess is that this is a consequence of the initial spec for S, i.e., an intention to design a data/statistics DSL [domain-specific language] from the ground-up. </p>\n\n<p><em>three</em> significant differences between R <code>list</code>s and mapping types in other languages in widespread use (e.g,. Python, Perl, JavaScript):</p>\n\n<p><em>first</em>, <code>list</code>s in R are an <em>ordered</em> collection, just like vectors, even though the values are keyed (ie, the keys can be any hashable value not just sequential integers). Nearly always, the mapping data type in other languages is <em>unordered</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>second</em>, <code>list</code>s can be returned from functions even though you never passed in a <code>list</code> when you called the function, and <em>even though</em> the function that returned the <code>list</code> doesn't contain an (explicit) <code>list</code> constructor (Of course, you can deal with this in practice by wrapping the returned result in a call to <code>unlist</code>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>x = strsplit(LETTERS[1:10], \"\")     # passing in an object of type 'character'\n\nclass(x)                            # returns 'list', not a vector of length 2\n# [1] list\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A <em>third</em> peculiar feature of R's <code>list</code>s: it doesn't seem that they can be members of another ADT, and if you try to do that then the primary container is coerced to a <code>list</code>. E.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code>x = c(0.5, 0.8, 0.23, list(0.5, 0.2, 0.9), recursive=TRUE)\n\nclass(x)\n# [1] list\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>my intention here is not to criticize the language or how it is documented; likewise, I'm not suggesting there is anything wrong with the <code>list</code> data structure or how it behaves. All I'm after is to correct is my understanding of how they work so I can correctly use them in my code. </p>\n\n<p>Here are the sorts of things I'd like to better understand:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>What are the rules which determine when a function call will return a <code>list</code> (e.g., <code>strsplit</code> expression recited above)?</p></li>\n<li><p>If I don't explicitly assign names to a <code>list</code> (e.g., <code>list(10,20,30,40)</code>) are the default names just sequential integers beginning with 1?  (I assume, but I am far from certain that the answer is yes, otherwise we wouldn't be able to coerce this type of <code>list</code> to a vector w/ a call to <code>unlist</code>.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Why do these two different operators, <code>[]</code>, and <code>[[]]</code>, return the <em>same</em> result?</p>\n\n<p><code>x = list(1, 2, 3, 4)</code></p>\n\n<p>both expressions return \"1\":</p>\n\n<p><code>x[1]</code></p>\n\n<p><code>x[[1]]</code></p></li>\n<li><p>why do these two expressions <strong>not</strong> return the same result?</p>\n\n<p><code>x = list(1, 2, 3, 4)</code></p>\n\n<p><code>x2 = list(1:4)</code></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please don't point me to the R Documentation (<a href=\"http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/base/list\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>?list</code></a>, <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-intro.html#Lists\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>R-intro</code></a>)--I have read it carefully and it does not help me answer the type of questions I recited just above.</p>\n\n<p>(lastly, I recently learned of and began using an R Package (available on CRAN) called <a href=\"http://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/packages/info/?hash\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>hash</code></a> which implements <em>conventional</em> map-type behavior via an S4 class; I can certainly recommend this Package.)</p>\n",

Nearly always, the mapping data type in other languages is <em>unordered</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>second</em>, <code>list</code>s can be returned from functions even though you never passed in a <code>list</code> when you called the function, and <em>even though</em> the function that returned the <code>list</code> doesn't contain an (explicit) <code>list</code> constructor (Of course, you can deal with this in practice by wrapping the returned result in a call to <code>unlist</code>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>x = strsplit(LETTERS[1:10], \"\")     # passing in an object of type 'character'\n\nclass(x)                            # returns 'list', not a vector of length 2\n# [1] list\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A <em>third</em> peculiar feature of R's <code>list</code>s: it doesn't seem that they can be members of another ADT, and if you try to do that then the primary container is coerced to a <code>list</code>. E.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code>x = c(0.5, 0.8, 0.23, list(0.5, 0.2, 0.9), recursive=TRUE)\n\nclass(x)\n# [1] list\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>my intention here is not to criticize the language or how it is documented; likewise, I'm not suggesting there is anything wrong with the <code>list</code> data structure or how it behaves. All I'm after is to correct is my understanding of how they work so I can correctly use them in my code. </p>\n\n<p>Here are the sorts of things I'd like to better understand:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>What are the rules which determine when a function call will return a <code>list</code> (e.g., <code>strsplit</code> expression recited above)?</p></li>\n<li><p>If I don't explicitly assign names to a <code>list</code> (e.g., <code>list(10,20,30,40)</code>) are the default names just sequential integers beginning with 1?  (I assume, but I am far from certain that the answer is yes, otherwise we wouldn't be able to coerce this type of <code>list</code> to a vector w/ a call to <code>unlist</code>.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Why do these two different operators, <code>[]</code>, and <code>[[]]</code>, return the <em>same</em> result?</p>\n\n<p><code>x = list(1, 2, 3, 4)</code></p>\n\n<p>both expressions return \"1\":</p>\n\n<p><code>x[1]</code></p>\n\n<p><code>x[[1]]</code></p></li>\n<li><p>why do these two expressions <strong>not</strong> return the same result?</p>\n\n<p><code>x = list(1, 2, 3, 4)</code></p>\n\n<p><code>x2 = list(1:4)</code></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please don't point me to the R Documentation (<a href=\"http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/base/list\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>?list</code></a>, <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-intro.html#Lists\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>R-intro</code></a>)--I have read it carefully and it does not help me answer the type of questions I recited just above.</p>\n\n<p>(lastly, I recently learned of and began using an R Package (available on CRAN) called <a href=\"http://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/packages/info/?hash\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>hash</code></a> which implements <em>conventional</em> map-type behavior via an S4 class; I can certainly recommend this Package.)</p>\n",

Code is harder to read. </p>\n\n<p>I came up with the most obvious idea: have an object encapsulating the data and pass it around instead of passing each parameter one by one. Here is what I came up with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DoSomeActionParameters\n{\n    public string A;\n    public string B;\n    public DateTime C;\n    public OtherEnum D;\n    public string E;\n    public string F;        \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That reduced my API declaration to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public ResultEnum DoSomeAction(DoSomeActionParameters parameters, out Guid code)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Nice. Looks very innocent but we actually introduced a huge change: we introduced mutability. Because what we previously had been doing was actually to pass an anonymous immutable object: function parameters on stack. Now we created a new class which is very mutable. We created the ability to manipulate the state of the <strong>caller</strong>. That sucks. Now I want my object immutable, what do I do?</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DoSomeActionParameters\n{\n    public string A { get; private set; }\n    public string B { get; private set; }\n    public DateTime C { get; private set; }\n    public OtherEnum D { get; private set; }\n    public string E { get; private set; }\n    public string F { get; private set; }        \n\n    public DoSomeActionParameters(string a, string b, DateTime c, OtherEnum d, \n     string e, string f)\n    {\n        this.A = a;\n        this.B = b;\n        // ... tears erased the text here\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see I actually re-created my original problem: too many parameters. It's obvious that that's not the way to go. What am I going to do? The last option to achieve such immutability is to use a \"readonly\" struct like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public struct DoSomeActionParameters\n{\n    public readonly string A;\n    public readonly string B;\n    public readonly DateTime C;\n    public readonly OtherEnum D;\n    public readonly string E;\n    public readonly string F;        \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That allows us to avoid constructors with too many parameters and achieve immutability. Actually it fixes all the problems (parameter ordering etc). Yet:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Everybody (including FXCop &amp; Jon Skeet) agree that <a href=\"http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/Chapter8/PropertiesMatter.aspx\">exposing public fields are bad</a>.</li>\n<li>Eric Lippert et al say <a href=\"http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/2010/07/01/WhenIsAReadonlyFieldNotReadonly.aspx\">relying on readonly fields for immutability is a lie</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That's when I got confused and decided to write this question: What's the most straightforward way in C# to avoid \"too many parameters\" problem without introducing mutability? Is it possible to use a readonly struct for that purpose and yet not have a bad API design?</p>\n\n<p><strong>CLARIFICATIONS:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Please assume there is no violation of single responsibiltiy principle. In my original case the function just writes given parameters to a single DB record.</li>\n<li>I'm not seeking a specific solution to the given function.

Now I want my object immutable, what do I do?</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DoSomeActionParameters\n{\n    public string A { get; private set; }\n    public string B { get; private set; }\n    public DateTime C { get; private set; }\n    public OtherEnum D { get; private set; }\n    public string E { get; private set; }\n    public string F { get; private set; }        \n\n    public DoSomeActionParameters(string a, string b, DateTime c, OtherEnum d, \n     string e, string f)\n    {\n        this.A = a;\n        this.B = b;\n        // ... tears erased the text here\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see I actually re-created my original problem: too many parameters. It's obvious that that's not the way to go. What am I going to do? The last option to achieve such immutability is to use a \"readonly\" struct like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public struct DoSomeActionParameters\n{\n    public readonly string A;\n    public readonly string B;\n    public readonly DateTime C;\n    public readonly OtherEnum D;\n    public readonly string E;\n    public readonly string F;        \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That allows us to avoid constructors with too many parameters and achieve immutability. Actually it fixes all the problems (parameter ordering etc). Yet:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Everybody (including FXCop &amp; Jon Skeet) agree that <a href=\"http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/Chapter8/PropertiesMatter.aspx\">exposing public fields are bad</a>.</li>\n<li>Eric Lippert et al say <a href=\"http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/2010/07/01/WhenIsAReadonlyFieldNotReadonly.aspx\">relying on readonly fields for immutability is a lie</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That's when I got confused and decided to write this question: What's the most straightforward way in C# to avoid \"too many parameters\" problem without introducing mutability? Is it possible to use a readonly struct for that purpose and yet not have a bad API design?</p>\n\n<p><strong>CLARIFICATIONS:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Please assume there is no violation of single responsibiltiy principle. In my original case the function just writes given parameters to a single DB record.</li>\n<li>I'm not seeking a specific solution to the given function. I'm seeking a generalized approach to such problems. I'm specifically interested in solving \"too many parameters\" problem without introducing mutability or a terrible design.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>The answers provided here have different advantages/disadvantages. Therefore I'd like to convert this to a community wiki. I think each answer with code sample and Pros/Cons would make a good guide for similar problems in the future. I'm now trying to find out how to do it.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>I'm currently trying to get an ANN to play a video game and  and I was hoping to get some help from the wonderful community here.</p>\n\n<p>I've settled on Diablo 2. Game play is thus in real-time and from an isometric viewpoint, with the player controlling a single avatar whom the camera is centered on. </p>\n\n<p>To make things concrete, the task is to get your character x experience points without having its health drop to 0, where experience point are gained through killing monsters.

Other users get access to 11GB of GPU RAM.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly 0.5GB GPU RAM is insufficient for most ML/DL work.</p>\n\n<p>If you're not sure what you get, here is little debug function I scraped together (only works with the GPU setting of the notebook):</p>\n\n<pre><code># memory footprint support libraries/code\n!ln -sf /opt/bin/nvidia-smi /usr/bin/nvidia-smi\n!pip install gputil\n!pip install psutil\n!pip install humanize\nimport psutil\nimport humanize\nimport os\nimport GPUtil as GPU\nGPUs = GPU.getGPUs()\n# XXX: only one GPU on Colab and isn’t guaranteed\ngpu = GPUs[0]\ndef printm():\n process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())\n print(\"Gen RAM Free: \" + humanize.naturalsize( psutil.virtual_memory().available ), \" | Proc size: \" + humanize.naturalsize( process.memory_info().rss))\n print(\"GPU RAM Free: {0:.0f}MB | Used: {1:.0f}MB | Util {2:3.0f}% | Total {3:.0f}MB\".format(gpu.memoryFree, gpu.memoryUsed, gpu.memoryUtil*100, gpu.memoryTotal))\nprintm()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Executing it in a jupyter notebook before running any other code gives me:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Gen RAM Free: 11.6 GB  | Proc size: 666.0 MB\nGPU RAM Free: 566MB | Used: 10873MB | Util  95% | Total 11439MB\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The lucky users who get access to the full card will see:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Gen RAM Free: 11.6 GB  | Proc size: 666.0 MB\nGPU RAM Free: 11439MB | Used: 0MB | Util  0% | Total 11439MB\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Do you see any flaw in my calculation of the GPU RAM availability, borrowed from GPUtil?</p>\n\n<p>Can you confirm that you get similar results if you run this code on Google Colab notebook?</p>\n\n<p>If my calculations are correct, is there any way to get more of that GPU RAM on the free box?</p>\n\n<p>update: I'm not sure why some of us get 1/20th of what other users get. e.g. the person who helped me to debug this is from India and he gets the whole thing!</p>\n\n<p><strong>note</strong>: please don't send any more suggestions on how to kill the potentially stuck/runaway/parallel notebooks that might be consuming parts of the GPU. No matter how you slice it, if you are in the same boat as I and were to run the debug code you'd see that you still get a total of 5% of GPU RAM (as of this update still).</p>\n",

It could probably store a TB just fine but eventually that's the point where you need to question whether SQLite is the best tool for the job and you probably want features from a full fledged database (remote clients, concurrent writes, read-only replicas, sharding, etc...).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Original:</p>\n<p>I know that sqlite doesn't perform well with extremely large database files even when they are supported (there used to be a comment on the sqlite website stating that if you need file sizes above 1GB you may want to consider using an enterprise rdbms. Can't find it anymore, might be related to an older version of sqlite).</p>\n<p>However, for my purposes I'd like to get an idea of how bad it really is before I consider other solutions.</p>\n<p>I'm talking about sqlite data files in the multi-gigabyte range, from 2GB onwards.\nAnyone have any experience with this? Any tips/ideas?</p>\n",

Who should keep the state of the current selected pin, the MapViewController, the MapPresenter or the MapWireframe in order for me to know, when going back, which pin should change color?</li>\n</ul>\n",

In my case I need to store references to these entities for use in future, storing is not transient.</p>\n\n<p>However the need to store this reference is for reporting and searching purposes only, and even if i did want to retrieve the child entity bu navigate via the root, the entities returned are immutable so I don't see any harm can be done or invariants broken.</p>\n\n<p>Is my thinking correct and if so why is it mentioned keep child entity references transient?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source code is below:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ProductIdentity : IEquatable&lt;ProductIdentity&gt;\n{\n    readonly string name;\n\n    public ProductIdentity(string name)\n    {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public bool Equals(ProductIdentity other)\n    {\n        return this.name.Equals(other.name);\n    }\n\n    public string Name\n    {\n        get { return this.name; }\n    }\n\n    public override int GetHashCode()\n    {\n        return this.name.GetHashCode();\n    }\n\n    public SelectionIdentity NewSelectionIdentity(string name)\n    {\n        return new SelectionIdentity(name, this);\n    }\n\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        return this.name;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SelectionIdentity : IEquatable&lt;SelectionIdentity&gt;\n{\n    readonly string name;\n    readonly ProductIdentity productIdentity;\n\n    public SelectionIdentity(string name, ProductIdentity productIdentity)\n    {\n        this.productIdentity = productIdentity;\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public bool Equals(SelectionIdentity other)\n    {\n        return (this.name == other.name) &amp;&amp; (this.productIdentity == other.productIdentity);\n    }\n\n    public override int GetHashCode()\n    {\n        return this.name.GetHashCode();\n    }\n\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        return this.productIdentity.ToString() + \"-\" + this.name;\n    }\n\n    public FeatureIdentity NewFeatureIdentity(string name)\n    {\n        return new FeatureIdentity(name, this);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class FeatureIdentity : IEquatable&lt;FeatureIdentity&gt;\n{\n    readonly SelectionIdentity selection;\n    readonly string name;\n\n    public FeatureIdentity(string name, SelectionIdentity selection)\n    {\n        this.selection = selection;\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public bool BelongsTo(SelectionIdentity other)\n    {\n        return this.selection.Equals(other);\n    }\n\n    public bool Equals(FeatureIdentity other)\n    {\n        return this.selection.Equals(other.selection) &amp;&amp; this.name == other.name;\n    }\n\n    public SelectionIdentity SelectionId\n    {\n        get { return this.selection; }\n    }\n\n    public string Name\n    {\n        get { return this.name; }\n    }\n\n    public override int GetHashCode()\n    {\n        return this.name.GetHashCode();\n    }\n\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        return this.SelectionId.ToString() + \"-\" + this.name; \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n",

    "title": "Software-design &amp; architecture: How to sync data from a directory-tree with a database",
    "body": "<p>I´m twisting my head now for a while and don´t get to a final solution. So I hope I might find some exchange or help on how to solve this issue here on an architectural level.</p>\n\n<p>I´m currently facing the following scenario:\nI want to write a web-application (I do it with Java, but this is not really relevant for a solution, as this is currently an question on a higher level), where there is this kind of relation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Event --1:n--&gt; Team --1:n--&gt; Participant\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Meaning: I have an event, in which will be a number of teams, having a number of participants. So far so good - this would be an easy relation in a SQL-database.</p>\n\n<p>But then there is also a directory-tree, representing the same relation in a file-structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+--event1\n|  +--team1\n|  |  +--participant1\n|  |  +--participant2\n|  |  +--participant3\n|  +--team2\n|  |  +--participant4\n|  +--team3\n+--event2\n|  +--team4\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(I think, you got the idea)\nSo in each participant´s directory are numerous files, which are copied to this directory via the file-system.

    "text": "Software-design &amp; architecture: How to sync data from a directory-tree with a database <p>I´m twisting my head now for a while and don´t get to a final solution. So I hope I might find some exchange or help on how to solve this issue here on an architectural level.</p>\n\n<p>I´m currently facing the following scenario:\nI want to write a web-application (I do it with Java, but this is not really relevant for a solution, as this is currently an question on a higher level), where there is this kind of relation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Event --1:n--&gt; Team --1:n--&gt; Participant\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Meaning: I have an event, in which will be a number of teams, having a number of participants. So far so good - this would be an easy relation in a SQL-database.</p>\n\n<p>But then there is also a directory-tree, representing the same relation in a file-structure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+--event1\n|  +--team1\n|  |  +--participant1\n|  |  +--participant2\n|  |  +--participant3\n|  +--team2\n|  |  +--participant4\n|  +--team3\n+--event2\n|  +--team4\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(I think, you got the idea)\nSo in each participant´s directory are numerous files, which are copied to this directory via the file-system. Whenever there is a directory on the file-system, this should be connected to a corresponding entry in the database, where there is some additional data, that should be displayed together with the files in the web-GUI. It is not defined, what will be there at first (database-entry or directory) as this is operated by different users.</p>\n\n<p>Now there are a couple of things to keep in mind, which make kind of sense to me:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When a directory-name changes (either event, team or participant), it should still relate to the same entry in the database (because there might be other entities, which still relate for example to a participant)</li>\n<li>The directory of any event/team/participant might be deleted - the data in the database should then remain.

A few simple examples:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Convert(\"days\",\"hours\")           // Yields 24\nConvert(\"revolutions\", \"degrees\") // Yields 360\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To make things a little more complicated, it must smoothly handle ambiguities between inputs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Convert(\"minutes\",\"hours\")        // Yields (1/60)\nConvert(\"minutes\",\"revolutions\")  // Yields (1/21600)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To make things even more fun, it must handle complex units without needing to enumerate all possibilities:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Convert(\"meters/second\",\"kilometers/hour\")\nConvert(\"miles/hour\",\"knots\")\nConvert(\"Newton meters\",\"foot pounds\")\nConvert(\"Acre feet\",\"meters^3\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There's no right or wrong answer, I'm looking for ideas on how to accomplish this. There's always a brute force solution, but I want something <em>elegant</em> that is simple and scalable.</p>\n",

In addition, I would like what are the best practices to solve some difficulties in the process. I would like to think in terms of scalability and how would i handle heavy read and write on database.   Please correct me if i’m wrong in any thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>First, I want to build a function <strong>subscribe</strong>/ <strong>unsubscribe</strong>. For user, I want to design mark feeds read/unread.  How can i design a system like this ? At first glance, the first problems i can see is that If I put every data in database, it could involved tons of read /write operation on database once thousands of users subscribe/unsubscribe from certain source or media source like CNN posts feed every 5 - 10 mins.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, database would be a bottleneck once the user grows into certain point. \nHow can I solve the issue of this ?  What’s the thoughts of solving this problem. Although database is a bottleneck in this point of view, we still need to have database but have a better design right ? I saw a lot of articles talking about denormalized data. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Question</strong>:\nWhat’s the best way to store like subscribers for each source ? </p>\n\n<p>In database, i can think of a table have “source_id” “user_id”, which user_id subscribes to source_id. Is this a good design or bad? If tons of user subscribe to new source, then database will be a burden.\nApproach I can think of this is using Redis, which provides fast write and fast read. \n<strong>Advantages</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fast read and write operations. </li>\n<li>Provide multiple data structures rather than simple key-value store.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Data need to fit in memory ⇒ <strong>solution</strong> to this: sharding. Sharding I\ncan use twemproxy to manage cluster.</p></li>\n<li><p>If data loss, we loss data ⇒ <strong>solution</strong>: replication, embrace\n“master-slave” setup. Write to master, read from slaves and backup\ndata to disk(data persistency). Additionally, take snapshot on hourly\nbasis.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now I listed pros and cons of moving to redis cluster, how do I store the relation between source and subscriber in redis ? Is it a good design if I have a hashmap, stored each source and each point to a list of subscriber. </p>\n\n<p>For example, </p>\n\n<p>\nCnn ⇒ (sub1, sub2, sub3, sub4….)\nEspn ⇒ (sub1,sub2,sub3,sub4..)\n…</p>\n\n<p>In terms of scalability, we can shard each source and user into each dedicated redis nodes.<br>\n&lt;&lt;== this is at least i can think of right now. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, we can store user info (what sources does user subscribes to) in redis as well and shard user to multiple cluster </p>\n\n<p>\nUser1 ⇒ (source1, source2, source4..)\nUser2 ⇒ (source1, source2, source4..)\n...</p>\n\n<p>For feed and posts from single source, i can have both database table and redis data structure (basically, my idea is to store everything in redis and database as backup, is it a good design consideration in this case? Maybe not everything, only active user in redis or recent feeds)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Database</strong>: i want to make as compact as possible, storing only a copy of it.\nfeedID, sourceID, created_timestamp, data</p>\n\n<p><strong>Redis</strong>: store feedID, source_id and content, and find subscriber based on source_id.</p>\n\n<p>For read/unread part, I don’t have clear idea how to design around these limitation.\nEvery user have join timestamp and server will push the feed (at most 10 feeds per source) if user haven’t read it.  What’s the good design to tell if user read data or not? My initial thoughts of this is to keep track of every feed user read or unread. But the table could grow linearly to the size of feed . In redis, i can design similar structure.</p>\n\n<p>Userid, feedid, status \nUser1, 001, read\nUser1, 002, read\nUser1, 003, unread</p>\n\n<p>At this point, my initial idea of setting up structure of data are like above. Redis runs “master-slave” setup and backup to disk on hourly basis. </p>\n\n<p>Now i’m going to think about how the process of subscribe/ unsubscribe function works. User click subscribe button on media page, for instance, CNN. web server receive request saying “user X” subscribes to “source Y”. On application layer logic, find the machine that has data of user X, this could be achieved by installing sharding map on every application server.  Work like this user_id mod shard = machineid.</p>\n\n<p>Once application lookup the server ip that has his (user X) data, application server talks to redis node and update the user structure with new source_id. Subscribe function is the same thing. </p>\n\n<p>For read/unread of specific feed on <strong>user X</strong>, the application lookup the redis node and update the structure of it, and redis asynchronously make updates to database. (here i embrace eventual consistency).</p>\n\n<p>Let’s thinking about how to design push/pull model. \nFor pushing notification, once there’s a recent feed, i can store it most recent feed in redis and update only the active user (the reason is to avoid as much write operation on database as possible). </p>\n\n<p>For pull model, only updates the user once they reload their home feed page, which also avoid lots of disk seek time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some points:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Only put active user in redis (logged in last 30 days)</li>\n<li>If a user is not active for 6 months, and recently logged back and\nwould like to check feeds. There’s another service reconstruct data\nfrom database and put into redis and serve the user.</li>\n<li>Store recent feed in redis and only push notification to  active\nsubscribers at this time. This is to avoid disk seek time on\ndatabase.</li>\n<li>In order to make feed sortable, design timestamp in feedID. For\nexample, first 10 bits of feedID is timestamp, and also we can have\nanother 10 bits for sourceID embedded in ID as well. This make feed\nsortable in nature.</li>\n<li>Application server can horizontally scale and hide behind\nload-balancer.</li>\n<li>Application server connect to redis cluster, and database is for\nstoring back and reconstruct data if possible (like inactive user\ncase)</li>\n<li>Redis apply “master-slave” setup. Write to master, read from slave\nand replicate data asynchronously. Data backup to disk on timely\nbasis. Also updates the database asynchronously.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is updating database asynchronously using redis when new events\ncoming a feasible solution ? or just keeping the replication is\nenough ?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I know it’s a long post and want to hear back from the community. Please correct me if i’m wrong or point out any so we can discuss more about approach.</p>\n",

If tons of user subscribe to new source, then database will be a burden.\nApproach I can think of this is using Redis, which provides fast write and fast read. \n<strong>Advantages</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fast read and write operations. </li>\n<li>Provide multiple data structures rather than simple key-value store.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Data need to fit in memory ⇒ <strong>solution</strong> to this: sharding. Sharding I\ncan use twemproxy to manage cluster.</p></li>\n<li><p>If data loss, we loss data ⇒ <strong>solution</strong>: replication, embrace\n“master-slave” setup. Write to master, read from slaves and backup\ndata to disk(data persistency). Additionally, take snapshot on hourly\nbasis.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now I listed pros and cons of moving to redis cluster, how do I store the relation between source and subscriber in redis ? Is it a good design if I have a hashmap, stored each source and each point to a list of subscriber. </p>\n\n<p>For example, </p>\n\n<p>\nCnn ⇒ (sub1, sub2, sub3, sub4….)\nEspn ⇒ (sub1,sub2,sub3,sub4..)\n…</p>\n\n<p>In terms of scalability, we can shard each source and user into each dedicated redis nodes.<br>\n&lt;&lt;== this is at least i can think of right now. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, we can store user info (what sources does user subscribes to) in redis as well and shard user to multiple cluster </p>\n\n<p>\nUser1 ⇒ (source1, source2, source4..)\nUser2 ⇒ (source1, source2, source4..)\n...</p>\n\n<p>For feed and posts from single source, i can have both database table and redis data structure (basically, my idea is to store everything in redis and database as backup, is it a good design consideration in this case? Maybe not everything, only active user in redis or recent feeds)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Database</strong>: i want to make as compact as possible, storing only a copy of it.\nfeedID, sourceID, created_timestamp, data</p>\n\n<p><strong>Redis</strong>: store feedID, source_id and content, and find subscriber based on source_id.</p>\n\n<p>For read/unread part, I don’t have clear idea how to design around these limitation.\nEvery user have join timestamp and server will push the feed (at most 10 feeds per source) if user haven’t read it.  What’s the good design to tell if user read data or not? My initial thoughts of this is to keep track of every feed user read or unread. But the table could grow linearly to the size of feed . In redis, i can design similar structure.</p>\n\n<p>Userid, feedid, status \nUser1, 001, read\nUser1, 002, read\nUser1, 003, unread</p>\n\n<p>At this point, my initial idea of setting up structure of data are like above. Redis runs “master-slave” setup and backup to disk on hourly basis. </p>\n\n<p>Now i’m going to think about how the process of subscribe/ unsubscribe function works. User click subscribe button on media page, for instance, CNN. web server receive request saying “user X” subscribes to “source Y”. On application layer logic, find the machine that has data of user X, this could be achieved by installing sharding map on every application server.  Work like this user_id mod shard = machineid.</p>\n\n<p>Once application lookup the server ip that has his (user X) data, application server talks to redis node and update the user structure with new source_id. Subscribe function is the same thing. </p>\n\n<p>For read/unread of specific feed on <strong>user X</strong>, the application lookup the redis node and update the structure of it, and redis asynchronously make updates to database. (here i embrace eventual consistency).</p>\n\n<p>Let’s thinking about how to design push/pull model. \nFor pushing notification, once there’s a recent feed, i can store it most recent feed in redis and update only the active user (the reason is to avoid as much write operation on database as possible). </p>\n\n<p>For pull model, only updates the user once they reload their home feed page, which also avoid lots of disk seek time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Some points:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Only put active user in redis (logged in last 30 days)</li>\n<li>If a user is not active for 6 months, and recently logged back and\nwould like to check feeds. There’s another service reconstruct data\nfrom database and put into redis and serve the user.</li>\n<li>Store recent feed in redis and only push notification to  active\nsubscribers at this time. This is to avoid disk seek time on\ndatabase.</li>\n<li>In order to make feed sortable, design timestamp in feedID. For\nexample, first 10 bits of feedID is timestamp, and also we can have\nanother 10 bits for sourceID embedded in ID as well. This make feed\nsortable in nature.</li>\n<li>Application server can horizontally scale and hide behind\nload-balancer.</li>\n<li>Application server connect to redis cluster, and database is for\nstoring back and reconstruct data if possible (like inactive user\ncase)</li>\n<li>Redis apply “master-slave” setup. Write to master, read from slave\nand replicate data asynchronously. Data backup to disk on timely\nbasis. Also updates the database asynchronously.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is updating database asynchronously using redis when new events\ncoming a feasible solution ? or just keeping the replication is\nenough ?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I know it’s a long post and want to hear back from the community. Please correct me if i’m wrong or point out any so we can discuss more about approach.</p>\n",

It would be more interesting if both objects were able to react simultaneously.</p></li>\n<li><p>There is not yet a system for limiting the amount of activity per \"turn\". There needs to be some sort of restriction on what can happen in a single \"turn\" to keep it interesting. Otherwise the fox could simply <code>run()</code> <code>run()</code> <code>run()</code> ... <code>run()</code> until it catches the rabbit on it's first turn. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are probably other problems that I haven't noticed yet.

My question is really about the design pattern / architecture.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Forrest() {\n        public $fox;\n        public $rabbit;\n        public $width = 100; //meters?\n        public $length = 100;\n\n        __construct() {\n                $this-&gt;fox = new Fox();\n                $this-&gt;rabbit = new Rabbit();\n                $this-&gt;theChase();\n        }\n\n        public function theChase() {\n                 while (!$this-&gt;rabbit-&gt;isBitten) {\n                         $this-&gt;rabbit-&gt;react($fox);\n                         $this-&gt;fox-&gt;react($rabbit);\n                 }\n                 log('The fox got the rabbit!');\n        }\n}\n\nabstract class Animal() {\n        public $speed;\n        public $hasTeeth = false;\n        public $position;\n        public $direction;\n        public $isBitten = false;\n        public function run($distance) {\n                // update coordinates based on direction and speed\n        }\n\n        public function bite($someone) {\n                 if (isCloseEnough( $someone ) &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;hasTeeth) {\n                          $someone-&gt;isBitten = true;\n                          log(get_class($this) . ' bit the ' . get_class($someone)); //the Fox bit the Rabbit\n                 }\n        }\n\n        public abstract function react($someone);\n}\n\nclass Rabbit extends Animal {\n         __construct() {\n                  $this-&gt;speed = 30;\n                  $this-&gt;position = [0,0];\n                  $this-&gt;direction = 'north';\n                  log(get_class($this) . ' starts at 0,0');\n         }\n\n         public react($fox) {\n                //avoid the fox\n         }\n}\n\nclass Fox extends Animal {\n          __construct() {\n                  $this-&gt;speed = 20;\n                  $this-&gt;position = [100,100];\n                  $this-&gt;direction = 'south';\n                  log (get_class($this) . ' starts at 100,100');\n          }\n\n          public react($rabbit) {\n                  //try to catch the rabbit\n          }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are two immediate problems I see with this approach:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>This architecture results in sequential, alternating actions. In other words, first the rabbit does something then the fox does something then the rabbit does something... This is more like a card game where each player takes turns moving. It would be more interesting if both objects were able to react simultaneously.</p></li>\n<li><p>There is not yet a system for limiting the amount of activity per \"turn\". There needs to be some sort of restriction on what can happen in a single \"turn\" to keep it interesting. Otherwise the fox could simply <code>run()</code> <code>run()</code> <code>run()</code> ... <code>run()</code> until it catches the rabbit on it's first turn. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are probably other problems that I haven't noticed yet. I <em>suspect</em> that the answer to both (1) and (2) above is some sort of event system that allows action from one animal to trigger action from the other and visa versa. I also think there may need to be some representation of time associated with each action, but I'm not entirely sure.</p>\n",

    "title": "Describe the architecture you use for Java web applications?",
    "body": "<p><strong>Let's share Java based web application architectures!</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are lots of different architectures for web applications which are to be implemented using Java. The answers to this question may serve as a library of various web application designs with their pros and cons. While I realize that the answers will be subjective, let's try to be as objective as we can and motivate the pros and cons we list.</p>\n\n<p>Use the detail level you prefer for describing your architecture. For your answer to be of any value you'll at least have to describe the major technologies and ideas used in the architecture you describe. And last but not least, <em>when</em> should we use your architecture?</p>\n\n<p>I'll start...</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Overview of the architecture</h1>\n\n<p>We use a 3-tier architecture based on open standards from Sun like Java EE, Java Persistence API, Servlet and Java Server Pages.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Persistence</li>\n<li>Business</li>\n<li>Presentation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The possible communication flows between the layers are represented by:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Persistence &lt;-&gt; Business &lt;-&gt; Presentation\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which for example means that the presentation layer never calls or performs persistence operations, it always does it through the business layer. This architecture is meant to fulfill the demands of a high availability web application.</p>\n\n<h2>Persistence</h2>\n\n<p>Performs create, read, update and delete (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CRUD</a>) persistence operations. In our case we are using (<a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/persistence.jsp\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Java Persistence API</a>) JPA and we currently use <a href=\"http://www.hibernate.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hibernate</a> as our persistence provider and use <a href=\"http://www.hibernate.org/397.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">its EntityManager</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This layer is divided into multiple classes, where each class deals with a certain type of entities (i.e. entities related to a shopping cart might get handled by a single persistence class) and is <em>used</em> by one and only one <em>manager</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition this layer also stores <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API#Entities\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JPA entities</a> which are things like <code>Account</code>, <code>ShoppingCart</code> etc.</p>\n\n<h2>Business</h2>\n\n<p>All logic which is tied to the web application functionality is located in this layer. This functionality could be initiating a money transfer for a customer who wants to pay for a product on-line using her/his credit card. It could just as well be creating a new user, deleting a user or calculating the outcome of a battle in a web based game.</p>\n\n<p>This layer is divided into multiple classes and each of these classes is annotated with <code>@Stateless</code> to become a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Beans\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Stateless Session Bean</a> (SLSB). Each SLSB is called a <em>manager</em> and for instance a manager could be a class annotated as mentioned called <code>AccountManager</code>.</p>\n\n<p>When <code>AccountManager</code> needs to perform CRUD operations it makes the appropriate calls to an instance of <code>AccountManagerPersistence</code>, which is a class in the persistence layer. A rough sketch of two methods in <code>AccountManager</code> could be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>...\npublic void makeExpiredAccountsInactive() {\n    AccountManagerPersistence amp = new AccountManagerPersistence(...)\n    // Calls persistence layer\n    List&lt;Account&gt; expiredAccounts = amp.getAllExpiredAccounts();\n    for(Account account : expiredAccounts) {\n        this.makeAccountInactive(account)\n    }\n}\npublic void makeAccountInactive(Account account) {\n    AccountManagerPersistence amp = new AccountManagerPersistence(...)\n    account.deactivate();\n    amp.storeUpdatedAccount(account); // Calls persistence layer\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We use <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bncij.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">container manager transactions</a> so we don't have to do transaction demarcation our self's. What basically happens under the hood is we initiate a transaction when entering the SLSB method and commit it (or rollback it) immediately before exiting the method. It's an example of convention over configuration, but we haven't had a need for anything but the default, Required, yet.</p>\n\n<p>Here is how The Java EE 5 Tutorial from Sun explains the <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bncij.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Required transaction attribute</a> for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB's):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the client is running within a\n  transaction and invokes the enterprise\n  bean’s method, the method executes\n  within the client’s transaction. If\n  the client is not associated with a\n  transaction, the container starts a\n  new transaction before running the\n  method.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Required attribute is the implicit\n  transaction attribute for all\n  enterprise bean methods running with\n  container-managed transaction\n  demarcation.

    "text": "Describe the architecture you use for Java web applications? <p><strong>Let's share Java based web application architectures!</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are lots of different architectures for web applications which are to be implemented using Java. The answers to this question may serve as a library of various web application designs with their pros and cons. While I realize that the answers will be subjective, let's try to be as objective as we can and motivate the pros and cons we list.</p>\n\n<p>Use the detail level you prefer for describing your architecture. For your answer to be of any value you'll at least have to describe the major technologies and ideas used in the architecture you describe. And last but not least, <em>when</em> should we use your architecture?</p>\n\n<p>I'll start...</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Overview of the architecture</h1>\n\n<p>We use a 3-tier architecture based on open standards from Sun like Java EE, Java Persistence API, Servlet and Java Server Pages.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Persistence</li>\n<li>Business</li>\n<li>Presentation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The possible communication flows between the layers are represented by:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Persistence &lt;-&gt; Business &lt;-&gt; Presentation\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which for example means that the presentation layer never calls or performs persistence operations, it always does it through the business layer. This architecture is meant to fulfill the demands of a high availability web application.</p>\n\n<h2>Persistence</h2>\n\n<p>Performs create, read, update and delete (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CRUD</a>) persistence operations. In our case we are using (<a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javaee/technologies/persistence.jsp\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Java Persistence API</a>) JPA and we currently use <a href=\"http://www.hibernate.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hibernate</a> as our persistence provider and use <a href=\"http://www.hibernate.org/397.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">its EntityManager</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This layer is divided into multiple classes, where each class deals with a certain type of entities (i.e. entities related to a shopping cart might get handled by a single persistence class) and is <em>used</em> by one and only one <em>manager</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition this layer also stores <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API#Entities\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JPA entities</a> which are things like <code>Account</code>, <code>ShoppingCart</code> etc.</p>\n\n<h2>Business</h2>\n\n<p>All logic which is tied to the web application functionality is located in this layer. This functionality could be initiating a money transfer for a customer who wants to pay for a product on-line using her/his credit card. It could just as well be creating a new user, deleting a user or calculating the outcome of a battle in a web based game.</p>\n\n<p>This layer is divided into multiple classes and each of these classes is annotated with <code>@Stateless</code> to become a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Beans\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Stateless Session Bean</a> (SLSB). Each SLSB is called a <em>manager</em> and for instance a manager could be a class annotated as mentioned called <code>AccountManager</code>.</p>\n\n<p>When <code>AccountManager</code> needs to perform CRUD operations it makes the appropriate calls to an instance of <code>AccountManagerPersistence</code>, which is a class in the persistence layer. A rough sketch of two methods in <code>AccountManager</code> could be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>...\npublic void makeExpiredAccountsInactive() {\n    AccountManagerPersistence amp = new AccountManagerPersistence(...)\n    // Calls persistence layer\n    List&lt;Account&gt; expiredAccounts = amp.getAllExpiredAccounts();\n    for(Account account : expiredAccounts) {\n        this.makeAccountInactive(account)\n    }\n}\npublic void makeAccountInactive(Account account) {\n    AccountManagerPersistence amp = new AccountManagerPersistence(...)\n    account.deactivate();\n    amp.storeUpdatedAccount(account); // Calls persistence layer\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We use <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bncij.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">container manager transactions</a> so we don't have to do transaction demarcation our self's. What basically happens under the hood is we initiate a transaction when entering the SLSB method and commit it (or rollback it) immediately before exiting the method. It's an example of convention over configuration, but we haven't had a need for anything but the default, Required, yet.</p>\n\n<p>Here is how The Java EE 5 Tutorial from Sun explains the <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bncij.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Required transaction attribute</a> for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB's):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the client is running within a\n  transaction and invokes the enterprise\n  bean’s method, the method executes\n  within the client’s transaction. If\n  the client is not associated with a\n  transaction, the container starts a\n  new transaction before running the\n  method.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Required attribute is the implicit\n  transaction attribute for all\n  enterprise bean methods running with\n  container-managed transaction\n  demarcation. You typically do not set\n  the Required attribute unless you need\n  to override another transaction\n  attribute. Because transaction\n  attributes are declarative, you can\n  easily change them later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Presentation</h2>\n\n<p>Our presentation layer is in charge of... presentation!

Partly contrary to what we just stated... it is a common view today to think that both the command handler and the application need to know how the transactional operation went. Results must be known...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Jimmy Bogard says &quot;<a href=\"https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2013/12/19/put-your-controllers-on-a-diet-posts-and-commands/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commands always have a result</a>&quot; but then makes extra effort to show how commands return void.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, do command handlers return values or not?</p>\n<h1>The Answer?</h1>\n<p>Taking a cue from Jimmy Bogard's &quot;<a href=\"https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2012/08/22/busting-some-cqrs-myths/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CQRS Myths</a>,&quot; I think the answer(s) to this question depends on what programmatic/contextual &quot;quadrant&quot; you are speaking of:</p>\n<pre><code>+-------------+-------------------------+-----------------+\n|             | Real-time, Synchronous  |  Queued, Async  |\n+-------------+-------------------------+-----------------+\n| Acceptance  | Exception/return-value* | &lt;see below&gt;     |\n| Fulfillment | return-value            | n/a             |\n+-------------+-------------------------+-----------------+\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Acceptance (e.g. validation)</h3>\n<p>Command &quot;Acceptance&quot; mostly refers to validation.  Presumably validation results must be given synchronously to the caller, whether or not the command &quot;fulfillment&quot; is synchronous or queued.</p>\n<p>However, it seems many practitioners don't initiate validation from within the command handler.  From what I've seen, it is either because (1) they've already found a fantastic way to handle validation at the application layer (i.e. an ASP.NET MVC controller checking valid state via data annotations) or (2) an architecture is in place which assumes commands are submitted to an (out of process) bus or queue.

    "text": "CQRS: Command Return Values <p>There seems to be endless confusion about whether commands should or should not have return values.  I would like to know if the confusion is simply because the participants have not stated their context or circumstances.</p>\n<h1>The Confusion</h1>\n<p>Here are examples of the confusion...</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Udi Dahan says commands are &quot;not returning errors to the client,&quot; but <a href=\"http://udidahan.com/2009/12/09/clarified-cqrs/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in the same article</a> he shows a diagram where commands indeed return errors to the client.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A Microsoft Press Store article states &quot;the command...doesn't return a response&quot; but then goes on to give an ambiguous caution:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As battlefield experience grows around CQRS, some practices consolidate and tend to become best practices. Partly contrary to what we just stated... it is a common view today to think that both the command handler and the application need to know how the transactional operation went. Results must be known...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Jimmy Bogard says &quot;<a href=\"https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2013/12/19/put-your-controllers-on-a-diet-posts-and-commands/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commands always have a result</a>&quot; but then makes extra effort to show how commands return void.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, do command handlers return values or not?</p>\n<h1>The Answer?</h1>\n<p>Taking a cue from Jimmy Bogard's &quot;<a href=\"https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2012/08/22/busting-some-cqrs-myths/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CQRS Myths</a>,&quot; I think the answer(s) to this question depends on what programmatic/contextual &quot;quadrant&quot; you are speaking of:</p>\n<pre><code>+-------------+-------------------------+-----------------+\n|             | Real-time, Synchronous  |  Queued, Async  |\n+-------------+-------------------------+-----------------+\n| Acceptance  | Exception/return-value* | &lt;see below&gt;     |\n| Fulfillment | return-value            | n/a             |\n+-------------+-------------------------+-----------------+\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Acceptance (e.g. validation)</h3>\n<p>Command &quot;Acceptance&quot; mostly refers to validation.  Presumably validation results must be given synchronously to the caller, whether or not the command &quot;fulfillment&quot; is synchronous or queued.</p>\n<p>However, it seems many practitioners don't initiate validation from within the command handler.  From what I've seen, it is either because (1) they've already found a fantastic way to handle validation at the application layer (i.e. an ASP.NET MVC controller checking valid state via data annotations) or (2) an architecture is in place which assumes commands are submitted to an (out of process) bus or queue.  These latter forms of asynchrony generally don't offer synchronous validation semantics or interfaces.</p>\n<p>In short, many designers might want the command handler to provide validation results as a (synchronous) return value, but they must live with the restrictions of they asynchrony tools they are using.</p>\n<h3>Fulfillment</h3>\n<p>Regarding &quot;fulfillment&quot; of a command, the client who issued the command might need to know the scope_identity for a newly created record or perhaps failure information - such as &quot;account overdrawn.&quot;</p>\n<p>In a real-time setting it seems that a return value makes the most sense; exceptions should not be used to communicate business-related failure outcomes.

Now what I am not sure about is which is the best place to get a <code>Ticket</code> persistence model from the repository and how to map it to the <code>TicketEntity</code> domain model</p>\n\n<p>I have done this in an application/service layer.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ApplicationService\n{\n    private ITicketsRepository ticketsRepository;\n\n    public ApplicationService(ITicketsRepository ticketsRepository)\n    {\n        this.ticketsRepository = ticketsRepository;\n    }\n\n    public bool IsTicketExpired(int ticketId)\n    {\n        Ticket persistanceModel = this.ticketsRepository.GetById(ticketId);\n        TicketEntity domainModel = new TicketEntity(\n            persistanceModel.Id,\n            persistanceModel.Cost,\n            persistanceModel.ExpiryDate);\n\n        return domainModel.IsTicketExpired();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My questions are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Are there any reasons opinion 1) would be preferred to opinion 2) other than speeding up development and reusing code.</p></li>\n<li><p>Are there any issues in my approach of mapping the models? Is there something I missed that would bring up issues when a solution grows?</p></li>\n</ol>\n",

    "body": "<p>Kafka splits incoming messages up into partitions, according to the partition assigned by the producer. Messages from partitions then get consumed by consumers in different consumer groups. </p>\n\n<p>This architecture makes me wary of using Kafka as a work/task queue, because I have to specify the partition at time of production, which indirectly limits which consumers can work on it because a partition is sent to only one consumer in a consumer group.

We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The &quot;Worst-Case-Scenario&quot;</h2>\n<p>We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:</p>\n<pre><code>sprintf(sSQL, &quot;INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')&quot;, sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM);\nsqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. <em>How slow?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 9933.61\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only <strong>85 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>Using a Transaction</h2>\n<p>By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:</p>\n<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n\npFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);\nwhile (!feof(pFile)) {\n\n    ...\n\n}\nfclose (pFile);\n\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 38.03\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to <strong>23,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>Using a Prepared Statement</h2>\n<p>Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use <code>sqlite3_prepare_v2</code> to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using <code>sqlite3_bind_text</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>/* Open input file and import into the database */\ncStartClock = clock();\n\nsprintf(sSQL, &quot;INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)&quot;);\nsqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &amp;stmt, &amp;tail);\n\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n\npFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);\nwhile (!feof(pFile)) {\n\n    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);\n\n    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, &quot;\\t&quot;);   /* Get Route */\n    sBR = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Branch */\n    sVR = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Version */\n    sST = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Stop Number */\n    sVI = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Vehicle */\n    sDT = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Date */\n    sTM = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Time */\n\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, sST, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, sVI, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n\n    sqlite3_step(stmt);\n\n    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);\n    sqlite3_reset(stmt);\n\n    n++;\n}\nfclose (pFile);\n\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n\nprintf(&quot;Imported %d records in %4.2f seconds\\n&quot;, n, (clock() - cStartClock) / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);\n\nsqlite3_finalize(stmt);\nsqlite3_close(db);\n\nreturn 0;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 16.27\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call <code>sqlite3_clear_bindings</code> and <code>sqlite3_reset</code>), but we've more than doubled our performance to <strong>53,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF</h2>\n<p>By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting <code>synchronous = OFF</code>, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:</p>\n<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */\nsqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);\nsqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA synchronous = OFF&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 12.41\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to <strong>69,600 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>\n<p>Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating <code>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</code>. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:</p>\n<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */\nsqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);\nsqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 13.50\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A little slower than the previous optimization at <strong>64,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF <em>and</em> PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>\n<p>Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):</p>\n<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */\nsqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);\nsqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA synchronous = OFF&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 12.00\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fantastic! We're able to do <strong>72,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>Using an In-Memory Database</h2>\n<p>Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:</p>\n<pre><code>#define DATABASE &quot;:memory:&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 10.94\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform <strong>79,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>Refactoring C Code</h2>\n<p>Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra <code>char*</code> assignment operations in the <code>while</code> loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of <code>strtok()</code> directly into <code>sqlite3_bind_text()</code>, and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:</p>\n<pre><code>pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);\nwhile (!feof(pFile)) {\n\n    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);\n\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */\n\n    sqlite3_step(stmt);        /* Execute the SQL Statement */\n    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    /* Clear bindings */\n    sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */\n\n    n++;\n}\nfclose (pFile);\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 8.94\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform <strong>96,700 inserts per second.</strong> I think it's safe to say that this is <em>plenty fast</em>. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Summary (so far)</h2>\n<p><em>I hope you're still with me!</em> The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go <strong>from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX</h2>\n<p>Before we start measuring <code>SELECT</code> performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:</p>\n<p><strong>Create Index then Insert Data</strong></p>\n<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n...\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 18.13\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Insert Data then Create Index</strong></p>\n<pre><code>...\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 13.66\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. <strong>Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.</p>\n",

We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The &quot;Worst-Case-Scenario&quot;</h2>\n<p>We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:</p>\n<pre><code>sprintf(sSQL, &quot;INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')&quot;, sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM);\nsqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. <em>How slow?</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 9933.61\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only <strong>85 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>Using a Transaction</h2>\n<p>By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:</p>\n<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n\npFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);\nwhile (!feof(pFile)) {\n\n    ...\n\n}\nfclose (pFile);\n\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 38.03\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to <strong>23,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>Using a Prepared Statement</h2>\n<p>Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use <code>sqlite3_prepare_v2</code> to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using <code>sqlite3_bind_text</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>/* Open input file and import into the database */\ncStartClock = clock();\n\nsprintf(sSQL, &quot;INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)&quot;);\nsqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &amp;stmt, &amp;tail);\n\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n\npFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);\nwhile (!feof(pFile)) {\n\n    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);\n\n    sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, &quot;\\t&quot;);   /* Get Route */\n    sBR = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Branch */\n    sVR = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Version */\n    sST = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Stop Number */\n    sVI = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Vehicle */\n    sDT = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Date */\n    sTM = strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;);        /* Get Time */\n\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, sST, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, sVI, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);\n\n    sqlite3_step(stmt);\n\n    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);\n    sqlite3_reset(stmt);\n\n    n++;\n}\nfclose (pFile);\n\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n\nprintf(&quot;Imported %d records in %4.2f seconds\\n&quot;, n, (clock() - cStartClock) / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);\n\nsqlite3_finalize(stmt);\nsqlite3_close(db);\n\nreturn 0;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 16.27\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call <code>sqlite3_clear_bindings</code> and <code>sqlite3_reset</code>), but we've more than doubled our performance to <strong>53,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF</h2>\n<p>By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting <code>synchronous = OFF</code>, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:</p>\n<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */\nsqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);\nsqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA synchronous = OFF&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 12.41\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to <strong>69,600 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>\n<p>Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating <code>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</code>. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:</p>\n<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */\nsqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);\nsqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 13.50\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A little slower than the previous optimization at <strong>64,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF <em>and</em> PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2>\n<p>Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):</p>\n<pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */\nsqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db);\nsqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA synchronous = OFF&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 12.00\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fantastic! We're able to do <strong>72,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>Using an In-Memory Database</h2>\n<p>Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:</p>\n<pre><code>#define DATABASE &quot;:memory:&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 10.94\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform <strong>79,000 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<h2>Refactoring C Code</h2>\n<p>Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra <code>char*</code> assignment operations in the <code>while</code> loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of <code>strtok()</code> directly into <code>sqlite3_bind_text()</code>, and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:</p>\n<pre><code>pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,&quot;r&quot;);\nwhile (!feof(pFile)) {\n\n    fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);\n\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */\n    sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, &quot;\\t&quot;), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */\n\n    sqlite3_step(stmt);        /* Execute the SQL Statement */\n    sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    /* Clear bindings */\n    sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */\n\n    n++;\n}\nfclose (pFile);\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 8.94\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform <strong>96,700 inserts per second.</strong> I think it's safe to say that this is <em>plenty fast</em>. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Summary (so far)</h2>\n<p><em>I hope you're still with me!</em> The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go <strong>from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX</h2>\n<p>Before we start measuring <code>SELECT</code> performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:</p>\n<p><strong>Create Index then Insert Data</strong></p>\n<pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, &quot;CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n...\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 18.13\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Insert Data then Create Index</strong></p>\n<pre><code>...\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;END TRANSACTION&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\nsqlite3_exec(db, &quot;CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')&quot;, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imported 864913 records in 13.66\nseconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. <strong>Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.</p>\n",

Afterwards, we iterate over the buffer and use an unrolled version of the x86 <code>popcount</code> intrinsic to perform the popcount. To get a more precise result, we do the popcount 10,000 times. We measure the times for the popcount. In the upper case, the inner loop variable is <code>unsigned</code>, in the lower case, the inner loop variable is <code>uint64_t</code>. I thought that this should make no difference, but the opposite is the case.</p>\n\n<h2>The (absolutely crazy) results</h2>\n\n<p>I compile it like this (g++ version: Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1):</p>\n\n<pre><code>g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here are the results on my <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Haswell</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29#Desktop_processors\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Core i7-4770K</a> CPU @ 3.50&nbsp;GHz, running <code>test 1</code> (so 1&nbsp;MB random data):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.401554 sec   <strong>26.113&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.759822 sec   <strong>13.8003&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As you see, the throughput of the <code>uint64_t</code> version is <strong>only half</strong> the one of the <code>unsigned</code> version! The problem seems to be that different assembly gets generated, but why? First, I thought of a compiler bug, so I tried <code>clang++</code> (Ubuntu <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Clang</a> version 3.4-1ubuntu3):</p>\n\n<pre><code>clang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 teest.cpp -o test\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Result: <code>test 1</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.398293 sec   <strong>26.3267 GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.680954 sec   <strong>15.3986 GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, it is almost the same result and is still strange. <em>But now it gets super strange.</em> I replace the buffer size that was read from input with a constant <code>1</code>, so I change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>uint64_t size = atol(argv[1]) &lt;&lt; 20;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to</p>\n\n<pre><code>uint64_t size = 1 &lt;&lt; 20;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thus, the compiler now knows the buffer size at compile time. Maybe it can add some optimizations! Here are the numbers for <code>g++</code>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.509156 sec   <strong>20.5944&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.508673 sec   <strong>20.6139&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, both versions are equally fast. However, the <code>unsigned</code> <strong>got even slower</strong>! It dropped from <code>26</code> to <code>20 GB/s</code>, thus replacing a non-constant by a constant value lead to a <strong>deoptimization</strong>. Seriously, I have no clue what is going on here! But now to <code>clang++</code> with the new version:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.677009 sec   <strong>15.4884&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.676909 sec   <strong>15.4906&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Wait, what?</em> Now, both versions dropped to the <strong>slow</strong> number of 15&nbsp;GB/s. Thus, replacing a non-constant by a constant value even lead to slow code in <strong>both</strong> cases for Clang!</p>\n\n<p>I asked a colleague with an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Bridge_%28microarchitecture%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ivy Bridge</a> CPU to compile my benchmark. He got similar results, so it does not seem to be Haswell. Because two compilers produce strange results here, it also does not seem to be a compiler bug. We do not have an AMD CPU here, so we could only test with Intel.</p>\n\n<h2>More madness, please!</h2>\n\n<p>Take the first example (the one with <code>atol(argv[1])</code>) and put a <code>static</code> before the variable, i.e.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>static uint64_t size=atol(argv[1])&lt;&lt;20;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here are my results in g++:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.396728 sec   <strong>26.4306 GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.509484 sec   <strong>20.5811 GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Yay, yet another alternative</em>. We still have the fast 26&nbsp;GB/s with <code>u32</code>, but we managed to get <code>u64</code> at least from the 13&nbsp;GB/s to the 20&nbsp;GB/s version! <strong>On my collegue's PC, the <code>u64</code> version became even faster than the <code>u32</code> version, yielding the fastest result of all.</strong> Sadly, this only works for <code>g++</code>, <code>clang++</code> does not seem to care about <code>static</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>My question</h2>\n\n<p>Can you explain these results? Especially:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How can there be such a difference between <code>u32</code> and <code>u64</code>?</li>\n<li>How can replacing a non-constant by a constant buffer size trigger <em>less optimal code</em>?</li>\n<li>How can the insertion of the <code>static</code> keyword make the <code>u64</code> loop faster? Even faster than the original code on my collegue's computer!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I know that optimization is a tricky territory, however, I never thought that such small changes can lead to a <strong>100% difference</strong> in execution time and that small factors like a constant buffer size can again mix results totally. Of course, I always want to have the version that is able to popcount 26&nbsp;GB/s. The only reliable way I can think of is copy paste the assembly for this case and use inline assembly. This is the only way I can get rid of compilers that seem to go mad on small changes. What do you think?

I have never thought about what type to use for a loop variable, but as you see such a minor change can make a <em>100%</em> difference! Even the storage type of a buffer can make a huge difference, as we saw with the insertion of the <code>static</code> keyword in front of the size variable! In the future, I will always test various alternatives on various compilers when writing really tight and hot loops that are crucial for system performance.</p>\n\n<p>The interesting thing is also that the performance difference is still so high although I have already unrolled the loop four times. So even if you unroll, you can still get hit by major performance deviations. Quite interesting.</p>\n",

I thought that this should make no difference, but the opposite is the case.</p>\n\n<h2>The (absolutely crazy) results</h2>\n\n<p>I compile it like this (g++ version: Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1):</p>\n\n<pre><code>g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here are the results on my <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Haswell</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29#Desktop_processors\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Core i7-4770K</a> CPU @ 3.50&nbsp;GHz, running <code>test 1</code> (so 1&nbsp;MB random data):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.401554 sec   <strong>26.113&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.759822 sec   <strong>13.8003&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As you see, the throughput of the <code>uint64_t</code> version is <strong>only half</strong> the one of the <code>unsigned</code> version! The problem seems to be that different assembly gets generated, but why? First, I thought of a compiler bug, so I tried <code>clang++</code> (Ubuntu <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Clang</a> version 3.4-1ubuntu3):</p>\n\n<pre><code>clang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 teest.cpp -o test\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Result: <code>test 1</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.398293 sec   <strong>26.3267 GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.680954 sec   <strong>15.3986 GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, it is almost the same result and is still strange. <em>But now it gets super strange.</em> I replace the buffer size that was read from input with a constant <code>1</code>, so I change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>uint64_t size = atol(argv[1]) &lt;&lt; 20;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to</p>\n\n<pre><code>uint64_t size = 1 &lt;&lt; 20;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thus, the compiler now knows the buffer size at compile time. Maybe it can add some optimizations! Here are the numbers for <code>g++</code>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.509156 sec   <strong>20.5944&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.508673 sec   <strong>20.6139&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now, both versions are equally fast. However, the <code>unsigned</code> <strong>got even slower</strong>! It dropped from <code>26</code> to <code>20 GB/s</code>, thus replacing a non-constant by a constant value lead to a <strong>deoptimization</strong>. Seriously, I have no clue what is going on here! But now to <code>clang++</code> with the new version:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.677009 sec   <strong>15.4884&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.676909 sec   <strong>15.4906&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Wait, what?</em> Now, both versions dropped to the <strong>slow</strong> number of 15&nbsp;GB/s. Thus, replacing a non-constant by a constant value even lead to slow code in <strong>both</strong> cases for Clang!</p>\n\n<p>I asked a colleague with an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Bridge_%28microarchitecture%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ivy Bridge</a> CPU to compile my benchmark. He got similar results, so it does not seem to be Haswell. Because two compilers produce strange results here, it also does not seem to be a compiler bug. We do not have an AMD CPU here, so we could only test with Intel.</p>\n\n<h2>More madness, please!</h2>\n\n<p>Take the first example (the one with <code>atol(argv[1])</code>) and put a <code>static</code> before the variable, i.e.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>static uint64_t size=atol(argv[1])&lt;&lt;20;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here are my results in g++:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.396728 sec   <strong>26.4306 GB/s</strong></li>\n<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.509484 sec   <strong>20.5811 GB/s</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Yay, yet another alternative</em>. We still have the fast 26&nbsp;GB/s with <code>u32</code>, but we managed to get <code>u64</code> at least from the 13&nbsp;GB/s to the 20&nbsp;GB/s version! <strong>On my collegue's PC, the <code>u64</code> version became even faster than the <code>u32</code> version, yielding the fastest result of all.</strong> Sadly, this only works for <code>g++</code>, <code>clang++</code> does not seem to care about <code>static</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>My question</h2>\n\n<p>Can you explain these results? Especially:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How can there be such a difference between <code>u32</code> and <code>u64</code>?</li>\n<li>How can replacing a non-constant by a constant buffer size trigger <em>less optimal code</em>?</li>\n<li>How can the insertion of the <code>static</code> keyword make the <code>u64</code> loop faster? Even faster than the original code on my collegue's computer!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I know that optimization is a tricky territory, however, I never thought that such small changes can lead to a <strong>100% difference</strong> in execution time and that small factors like a constant buffer size can again mix results totally. Of course, I always want to have the version that is able to popcount 26&nbsp;GB/s. The only reliable way I can think of is copy paste the assembly for this case and use inline assembly. This is the only way I can get rid of compilers that seem to go mad on small changes. What do you think?

    "title": "Swift Beta performance: sorting arrays",
    "body": "<p>I was implementing an algorithm in Swift Beta and noticed that the performance was very poor. After digging deeper I realized that one of the bottlenecks was something as simple as sorting arrays. The relevant part is here:</p>\n\n<pre><code>let n = 1000000\nvar x =  [Int](repeating: 0, count: n)\nfor i in 0..&lt;n {\n    x[i] = random()\n}\n// start clock here\nlet y = sort(x)\n// stop clock here\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In C++, a similar operation takes <strong>0.06s</strong> on my computer.</p>\n\n<p>In Python, it takes <strong>0.6s</strong> (no tricks, just y = sorted(x) for a list of integers).</p>\n\n<p>In Swift it takes <strong>6s</strong> if I compile it with the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xcrun swift -O3 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And it takes as much as <strong>88s</strong> if I compile it with the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>xcrun swift -O0 -sdk `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Timings in Xcode with \"Release\" vs. \"Debug\" builds are similar.</p>\n\n<p>What is wrong here? I could understand some performance loss in comparison with C++, but not a 10-fold slowdown in comparison with pure Python.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> weather noticed that changing <code>-O3</code> to <code>-Ofast</code> makes this code run almost as fast as the C++ version! However, <code>-Ofast</code> changes the semantics of the language a lot — in my testing, it <strong>disabled the checks for integer overflows and array indexing overflows</strong>. For example, with <code>-Ofast</code> the following Swift code runs silently without crashing (and prints out some garbage):</p>\n\n<pre><code>let n = 10000000\nprint(n*n*n*n*n)\nlet x =  [Int](repeating: 10, count: n)\nprint(x[n])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So <code>-Ofast</code> is not what we want; the whole point of Swift is that we have the safety nets in place. Of course, the safety nets have some impact on the performance, but they should not make the programs 100 times slower. Remember that Java already checks for array bounds, and in typical cases, the slowdown is by a factor much less than 2. And in Clang and GCC we have got <code>-ftrapv</code> for checking (signed) integer overflows, and it is not that slow, either.</p>\n\n<p>Hence the question: how can we get reasonable performance in Swift without losing the safety nets?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I did some more benchmarking, with very simple loops along the lines of</p>\n\n<pre><code>for i in 0..&lt;n {\n    x[i] = x[i] ^ 12345678\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Here the xor operation is there just so that I can more easily find the relevant loop in the assembly code.

The inner loop spans 88 lines of assembly code. I did not try to understand all of it, but the most suspicious parts are 13 invocations of \"callq _swift_retain\" and another 13 invocations of \"callq _swift_release\". That is, <strong>26 subroutine calls in the inner loop</strong>!</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> In comments, Ferruccio asked for benchmarks that are fair in the sense that they do not rely on built-in functions (e.g. sort).

    "title": "Efficiency of Java &quot;Double Brace Initialization&quot;?",
    "body": "<p>In <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15496/hidden-features-of-java\">Hidden Features of Java</a> the top answer mentions <a href=\"http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?DoubleBraceInitialization\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Double Brace Initialization</a>, with a <em>very</em> enticing syntax:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Set&lt;String&gt; flavors = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;() {{\n    add(\"vanilla\");\n    add(\"strawberry\");\n    add(\"chocolate\");\n    add(\"butter pecan\");\n}};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This idiom creates an anonymous inner class with just an instance initializer in it, which \"can use any [...] methods in the containing scope\".  </p>\n\n<p>Main question: Is this as <strong>inefficient</strong> as it sounds?  Should its use be limited to one-off initializations?  (And of course showing off!)</p>\n\n<p>Second question: The new HashSet must be the \"this\" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism?  </p>\n\n<p>Third question: Is this idiom too <strong>obscure</strong> to use in production code?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Very, very nice answers, thanks everyone.

    "text": "Efficiency of Java &quot;Double Brace Initialization&quot;? <p>In <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15496/hidden-features-of-java\">Hidden Features of Java</a> the top answer mentions <a href=\"http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?DoubleBraceInitialization\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Double Brace Initialization</a>, with a <em>very</em> enticing syntax:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Set&lt;String&gt; flavors = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;() {{\n    add(\"vanilla\");\n    add(\"strawberry\");\n    add(\"chocolate\");\n    add(\"butter pecan\");\n}};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This idiom creates an anonymous inner class with just an instance initializer in it, which \"can use any [...] methods in the containing scope\".  </p>\n\n<p>Main question: Is this as <strong>inefficient</strong> as it sounds?  Should its use be limited to one-off initializations?  (And of course showing off!)</p>\n\n<p>Second question: The new HashSet must be the \"this\" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism?  </p>\n\n<p>Third question: Is this idiom too <strong>obscure</strong> to use in production code?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Very, very nice answers, thanks everyone.

These times are obtained consistently and with practically no noise (gcc 4.7.2, x86_64 GNU/Linux, Intel Core i5-3320M).</p>\n\n<p><em>(Update: I have moved all assembly code to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GitHub</a>: They made the post bloated and apparently add very little value to the questions as the <code>fno-align-*</code> flags have the same effect.)</em></p>\n\n<p>Here is the generated assembly with <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/baharev/7069582#file-os\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>-Os</code></a> and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/baharev/7069582#file-o2\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>-O2</code></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, my understanding of assembly is very limited, so I have no idea whether what I did next was correct: I grabbed the assembly for <code>-O2</code> and merged all its differences into the assembly for <code>-Os</code> <em>except</em> the <code>.p2align</code> lines, result <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/baharev/7069582#file-o2merged\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. This code still runs in 0.38s and <strong>the only difference is the</strong> <code>.p2align</code> <strong>stuff.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If I guess correctly, these are paddings for stack alignment. According to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/7912464/341970\">Why does GCC pad functions with NOPs?</a> it is done in the hope that the code will run faster, but apparently this optimization backfired in my case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is it the padding that is the culprit in this case? Why and how?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The noise it makes pretty much makes timing micro-optimizations impossible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I make sure that such accidental lucky / unlucky alignments are not interfering when I do micro-optimizations (unrelated to stack alignment) on C or C++ source code?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Following <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/19471213/341970\">Pascal Cuoq's answer</a> I tinkered a little bit with the alignments. By passing <code>-O2 -fno-align-functions -fno-align-loops</code> to gcc, all <code>.p2align</code> are gone from the assembly and the generated executable runs in 0.38s. According to the <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">gcc documentation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>-Os enables all -O2 optimizations [but] -Os disables the following optimization flags:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  -falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops\n  -falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -freorder-blocks-and-partition\n  -fprefetch-loop-arrays\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So, it pretty much seems like a (mis)alignment issue.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am still skeptical about <code>-march=native</code> as suggested in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/19471823/341970\">Marat Dukhan's answer</a>. I am not convinced that it isn't just interfering with this (mis)alignment issue; it has absolutely no effect on my machine.

    "text": "Why does GCC generate 15-20% faster code if I optimize for size instead of speed? <p>I first noticed in 2009 that GCC (at least on my projects and on my machines) have the tendency to generate noticeably faster code if I optimize for <strong>size</strong> (<code>-Os</code>) instead of speed (<code>-O2</code> or <code>-O3</code>), and I have been wondering ever since why.</p>\n\n<p>I have managed to create (rather silly) code that shows this surprising behavior and is sufficiently small to be posted here.</p>\n\n<pre><code>const int LOOP_BOUND = 200000000;\n\n__attribute__((noinline))\nstatic int add(const int&amp; x, const int&amp; y) {\n    return x + y;\n}\n\n__attribute__((noinline))\nstatic int work(int xval, int yval) {\n    int sum(0);\n    for (int i=0; i&lt;LOOP_BOUND; ++i) {\n        int x(xval+sum);\n        int y(yval+sum);\n        int z = add(x, y);\n        sum += z;\n    }\n    return sum;\n}\n\nint main(int , char* argv[]) {\n    int result = work(*argv[1], *argv[2]);\n    return result;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I compile it with <code>-Os</code>, it takes 0.38&nbsp;s to execute this program, and 0.44&nbsp;s if it is compiled with <code>-O2</code> or <code>-O3</code>. These times are obtained consistently and with practically no noise (gcc 4.7.2, x86_64 GNU/Linux, Intel Core i5-3320M).</p>\n\n<p><em>(Update: I have moved all assembly code to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GitHub</a>: They made the post bloated and apparently add very little value to the questions as the <code>fno-align-*</code> flags have the same effect.)</em></p>\n\n<p>Here is the generated assembly with <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/baharev/7069582#file-os\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>-Os</code></a> and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/baharev/7069582#file-o2\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>-O2</code></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, my understanding of assembly is very limited, so I have no idea whether what I did next was correct: I grabbed the assembly for <code>-O2</code> and merged all its differences into the assembly for <code>-Os</code> <em>except</em> the <code>.p2align</code> lines, result <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/baharev/7069582#file-o2merged\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. This code still runs in 0.38s and <strong>the only difference is the</strong> <code>.p2align</code> <strong>stuff.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If I guess correctly, these are paddings for stack alignment. According to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/7912464/341970\">Why does GCC pad functions with NOPs?</a> it is done in the hope that the code will run faster, but apparently this optimization backfired in my case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is it the padding that is the culprit in this case? Why and how?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The noise it makes pretty much makes timing micro-optimizations impossible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can I make sure that such accidental lucky / unlucky alignments are not interfering when I do micro-optimizations (unrelated to stack alignment) on C or C++ source code?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Following <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/19471213/341970\">Pascal Cuoq's answer</a> I tinkered a little bit with the alignments. By passing <code>-O2 -fno-align-functions -fno-align-loops</code> to gcc, all <code>.p2align</code> are gone from the assembly and the generated executable runs in 0.38s. According to the <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">gcc documentation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>-Os enables all -O2 optimizations [but] -Os disables the following optimization flags:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  -falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops\n  -falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -freorder-blocks-and-partition\n  -fprefetch-loop-arrays\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So, it pretty much seems like a (mis)alignment issue.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am still skeptical about <code>-march=native</code> as suggested in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/19471823/341970\">Marat Dukhan's answer</a>.

No symbols have been loaded for this document.' message to appear in the IDE, but it only affects the Web Appliaction, I can debug the Silverlight and the Winform App.</p>\n\n<p>What I tried / did to get rid of the message:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reset Visual Studio Settings</li>\n<li>removed all files in every \\Temporary ASP.NET Files Folder (there is one for each 32bit/64bit and for Framework 2.0 and 4.0)</li>\n<li>tried to debug using Visual Studio Integrated Web server - normally I use IIS, in the project output of the solution I deleted every obj and bin folders in every project folder</li>\n<li>created a new solution and added all the projects to this new solution</li>\n<li>deleted the solution suo file</li>\n<li>created a new ASP.NET Web Application to test if it is a VS-installation issue => I can debug this new project/solution</li>\n<li>rebooted the machine several times</li>\n<li>repaired the vs.net installation</li>\n<li>did an IISReset</li>\n<li>removed the Web App from IIS</li>\n<li>used the Create Virtual Directory Button under Project Properties of the Web App to create a new Web App in IIS</li>\n<li>changed the Framework Version of every project from 3.5 to 4.0</li>\n<li>Opened the Solution on my second machine => same behavior</li>\n<li>crawled Microsoft Connect for bugs / similar issues</li>\n<li>SPENT 7 HOURS. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, this happens the 2nd time in my life. last time I solved it by deleting Temporary ASP.NET Files Folder, but this time I need your help.</p>\n",
