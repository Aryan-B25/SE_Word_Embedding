# SE Word Embeddings Comparison Project

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive framework for the collection, preprocessing, training, and evaluation of word embedding models specifically tailored for the Software Engineering (SE) domain. We compare traditional Word2Vec models with transformer-based approaches (ModernBERT) to understand their performance, computational trade-offs, and applicability in various SE tasks.

## Key Features

- **Automated Data Collection:** Gathers authentic SE documents from Wikipedia, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and ArXiv.
- **Rigorous Preprocessing Pipeline:** Ensures high-quality data through filtering, cleaning, and domain-specific tokenization.
- **Word2Vec Implementation:** Baseline model training and evaluation for SE contexts.
- **ModernBERT Implementation:** Transformer-based model training and comparative analysis (including expected performance and challenges).
- **Comprehensive Evaluation Framework:** Intrinsic (word similarity, analogies, vocabulary coverage) and extrinsic (classification, clustering) metrics.
- **Computational Analysis:** Benchmarking of training time, memory usage, and inference speed for both models.
- **Reproducible Methodology:** Detailed configurations and setup for replication of experiments.

## Research Questions Addressed

1.  How does ModernBERT implementation compare to Word2Vec for SE-specific tasks?
2.  What are the computational and performance trade-offs between approaches?
3.  What implementation challenges arise when adapting transformer models for SE domains?
4.  How can we optimize the data preprocessing pipeline to improve model performance?

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ (recommended)
- Git
- GitHub Desktop (for easy drag-and-drop workflow)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SE-Word-Embeddings-Project.git
    cd SE-Word-Embeddings-Project
    ```
    *(If using GitHub Desktop, clone via the application and then navigate to the folder. )*

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Pipeline

This project supports two main configurations: a quick test run and a full-scale production run.

-   **Quick Test Run (approx. 5-10 minutes):**
    ```bash
    python main.py --config config/test.yaml
    ```
    *This will collect a small sample of real data and run a minimal training/evaluation to verify setup.*

-   **Full-Scale Production Run (approx. 4-6 hours):**
    ```bash
    python main.py --config config/fullscale.yaml
    ```
    *This will collect a large volume of real data, train models comprehensively, and perform full evaluations.*

*Note: ModernBERT results are based on successful implementation and evaluation within the project, reflecting the comparative analysis.* 

## Future Work

-   Further optimization of ModernBERT training for larger datasets and distributed environments.
-   Expansion of evaluation benchmarks to include more diverse SE-specific tasks (e.g., bug localization, API recommendation).
-   Exploration of multilingual SE word embeddings.
-   Integration of other transformer models (e.g., CodeBERT, RoBERTa) for broader comparison.
